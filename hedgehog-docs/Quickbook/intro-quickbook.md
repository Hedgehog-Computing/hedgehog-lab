Here is an overall view of the Hedgehog Computing Project.

### A Programming Environment inside a Browser

No installation or package management is required. Just open a browser and start coding, with a full-featured programming environment. Hedgehog Lab will execute and configure everything automatically. Hedgehog Lab is a web-based programming environment that runs in a browser, includes a text editor, a compiler, and an output window.

### **Hedgehog Script**: Built on top of JavaScript, easy to learn

In **Hedgehog Script**, most of the basic syntax and features are similar to the JavaScript. Variable and expressions, functions, classes, modules, etc. are all the same. The only difference is that Hedgehog Script supports operator overloading for matrix, vector and symbolic computing, which makes it easier to write linear algebra, statistics and machine learning code.

Here is an exmaple:

To write snippets or scripts in Hedgehog Lab, you will need to understand some basic JavaScript/TypeScript. This includes but is not limited to: 
- Variables and expressions
- Control flow
- Functions
- Classes
- Packages and modules
 

This is what **Hedgehog Script** covers and gives examples of. There are many other topics that can be used in your scripts, and you can learn about them from MDN: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

### Math, Linear Algebra, Statistics and Machine Learning

With sweet syntax sugar **operator overload**, Hedgehog Script makes it easy to write linear algebra, statistics and machine learning code, with Matlab or Python-like syntax. Also symbolic computing is supported.

Here is an exmaple:

Also there are many built-in functions and classes for math, linear algebra, statistics and machine learning in both **JavaScript** and **Hedgehog Script**, including **math.js** and **tensorflow.js**.

### Out-of-the-box Module Management

Hedgehog Lab supports out-of-the-box module management. You don't need to install any package manager, just use the `*import` statement to import modules from the web. Hedgehog Lab will automatically download and install the modules for you.

Here are four examples of using modules in Hedgehog Lab:

### Overall

Now that you understand the Hedgehog Lab itself, and the prerequisites (JavaScript namely), and how to read the reference material, feel free to dive in and write your own snippets, read our source code, read the reference libraries 'Math' and build upon what's built! 

Thank you and we hope you enjoy.
