# Math Intro

## Reference library & Functions

In this section, we'll cover the various mathematical functions available in hedgehog lab. It will be represented in a reference format.

Functions and topics to be included are but not limited to : 

<ul>
      <li>Basic Operations</li>
      Basic operations are what one may imagine them to be. 
      Something as simple as multiplying two matrices element wise, or finding the factorial.
      <li>Decompositions </li>
      Decompositions are ways to take a matrix and split it into multiple special matrices, so that when they're multiplied together again, they give back the original matrix. Example is A = LU, the LU decomposition.
      <li>Linear Equation Systems</li>
      In this section, we have several methods for finding solutions to a system of linear equations. Depending on the type of matrix the linear equations form, you may have different options.
      <li>Misc</li>
      This has functions that don't fit into any other category, namely `test()` and `all()`
      <li>Properties</li>
      Properties of a given matrix such as a determinant, trace, etc are presented in this section.
      <li>Transformation and creations</li>
      Lastly, this section describes different functions to generate matrices (outside of the base code) and create special ones such as a transpose or an inverse.
