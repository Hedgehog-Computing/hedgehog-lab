#### `quantile(matrix: any[] | Mat | Tensor, q: number) : any[]`

**param** `matrix` - an `Array`, `Mat` or `Tensor` - where the data is stored to find the quantiles of

**param** `q` a `number` in the interval [0, 1]

**returns** - `any[]` - an `Array` representing the quantile (all the numbers that fall below the quantile limit)

The quantile is a descriptive statistic. Note that it is similar to the percentile, or `percentile()`, another function in this book. The quantile is a number between 0 and 1 that cuts the distribution of points or values in an `Array` evenly (by numerical order) and labels them with their appropriate quantile. For example, taking all the `Array`'s data in order, splitting it in half evenly, and taking the middle point is quantile 0.5. Hence, `iqr`(interquartile range) is also related to quantiles.

*Quartiles* are quantiles cut at 1/4 parts - 0.25, 0.50, 0.75. The other quantiles are arbitrary. Overall, if you want to find the bottom `y`% of data, you can simply call `quantile(matrix, y/100)`. That is because `y/100` converts a percentage value into a quantile value. For example, if I want the bottom 23% of values in my 2-D `Array` called `matA`, I would simply call `quantile(matA, .23)`. This gives me the .23 quantile of the input, an `Array` with all values below 0.23.
