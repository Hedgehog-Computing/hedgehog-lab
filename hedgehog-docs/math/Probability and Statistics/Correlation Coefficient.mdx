#### `correcoef(A: any[] | Mat, B: any[] | Mat): Number`


**param** `A` - the first part of the pair of data to find the correlation coefficient of. Needs to be a JS array or Mat.

**param** `B` - similar to `A`, needs to be the same length and a JS array or Mat holding data.

**returns** - a number representing the correlation coefficient of `A` and `B`, between -1 and 1.

If `A` and `B` are not 1-d JS array, then they will be flattened to 1-d.


The correlation coefficient can be thought of as a number that represents how strongly 2 variables are connected. It takes in two variables of data, A and B, where A contains data, say [0,1,1,2,2,3] and B contains data, say [0,0,1,1,2,3,].
It then effectively finds the distances between each point for each indice and keeps a track of it as a sum. 

Overall, it outputs a number between -1 and 1. The closer it is to 1, the stronger the correlation. The closer to -1, the stronger the inverse correlation. 

A practical use of this is something like an array of housing prices over the years - A and an array of crime amount over the years - B. Is crime correlated to housing prices? If so, how **much** is it correlated?

To find the correlation coefficient of the two inputs, use the following formula:

<MathJaxContext>
      <MathJax>{"$$r = \\frac{\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x}) (y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sqrt{\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2 \\sum(y_i - \\bar{y})^2}}$$"}</MathJax>
</MathJaxContext>
