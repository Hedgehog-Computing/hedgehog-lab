#### `mink(input1: any[] | Mat, k: Number, dim: Number) : any[] | Mat`

**param** `input1` - the 1d list or 2d matrix/JS array to find the k smallest elements of 

**param** `k` - the number of smallest elements we want to find. For example, k=2 will return a subset of the two smallest elements. (in the direction of `dim`)

**param** `dim` '1' | '2' - the direction you want to find the smallest elements for 2d matrices. Dim =1 means column and dim =2 means row. This is needed because the user may want to differentiate and only find the smallest say, 2, elements in a 3x3 matrix in the direction of columns. 

**returns:** `any[] | Mat` - If A is a matrix, it will return a matrix whose columns or rows contain the k smallest elements of each columns or rows of A (based on the parameter `dim`), specifically returned as a Mat object. If it is a list, it'll return a list containing the k smallest elements of that list

This function is simple despite having a large amount of parameters and text. It effectively returns the k smallest elements. And for a matrix, you have to provide it a dimension (default is dim = 1, columns), it will return the k smallest elements in each column of A, as a new matrix. It's like `min()` where it returns the smallest values, but can returns more now, specified by the parameter `k`.
