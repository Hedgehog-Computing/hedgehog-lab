##this isnt working correctly, fix toeplitz (toeplitzsquare is not a constructor)

#### `name(c: any[], r: any[]) : Mat`

**param** `c` - OPTIONAL PARAMETER - a 1xn matrix that defines the first column of the final matrix. This is not necessary 

**param** `r` - a 1xn matrix that defines the first row of the final matrix. This is necessary and defines the structure of the Toeplitz matrix. 

**returns:** `Mat` - a matrix, namely the Toeplitz matrix, of size n x n, where n is the size of the parameter matrix, or rather, the length of it. 

Toeplitz matrices are matrices with entries on the diagonals all being equal (every diagonal, not just the main diagonal) Example:
  1 2 3 4 5
  6 1 2 3 4
  7 6 1 2 3 is a Toeplitz matrix. 
  
  This function constructs or creates a toeplitz matrix **given** a 1 x n matrix, that is the first row of the final matrix. Optionally you can give another parameter, `c`, the first column of the final matrix. It also needs to be given as a 1 x n matrix. These given matrices define the creation of the toeplitz matrix and its structure.
