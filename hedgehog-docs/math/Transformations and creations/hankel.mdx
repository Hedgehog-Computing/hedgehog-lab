# `hankel`

Creates a Hankel matrix given a list.

---

## Syntax

#### `hankel(list: any[]) : Mat`

**param** `list` - A 1-D `Array` or just a series of numbers, **must** be odd in length.

**returns:** `Mat` - A Hankel matrix. Where the skewing up-right diagonals are constant.

---

## Description

This function constructs a Hankel matrix. A Hankel matrix is much easier understood when seen than when said. However, to explain it - if you take any element on the left hand side of the matrix and follow its diagonal in the up-right direction, it should be constant. An example is:

```js
[[1, 2, 3],
[2, 3, 4],
[3, 4, 5]]
```
