#### `gcd(dataIn1: number | any[] | Mat, dataIn2: number | any[] | Mat) : number | Mat`


**param** `dataIn1` - Note: `dataIn1` and `dataIn2` must be the same type **unless** you input a list only. The first input is the first part of the pair of items you want to find the `gcd` of. This function can find the `gcd` of two integers, or two 2-D or 1-D `Array`/`Mat` objects

**param** `dataIn2` The other part of the pair. Must be identical to the type of `dataIn1`. It is the item to find the `gcd` of, whether its two integers, or two matrices, or two lists. 

**returns:** `number | Mat` - The greatest common divisor is returned as an `integer` for the cases of 2 integers, or it returns a `Mat` with the `gcd` in each indice, element-wise. For example, given two 2x2 matrices, it will find the `gcd` of `a[0][0]` and `b[0][0]` and put it into the return matrix indice `result[0][0]`.

## Description

This function is the greatest common divisor function. The greatest common divisor is famous - it is the shared integer between 2 (or more) numbers, such that it divides both of the numbers, and there is no number that can divide them that is larger. I.e. the largest shared divisor. 

This function returns the `gcd` of two integers however, if given lists, it will return the `gcd` element-wise of each list indice. If given just a list, it will give the `gcd` of all elements in that list. An example is shown below that may clear this up. For other structures, it also does element-wise computation by index.
