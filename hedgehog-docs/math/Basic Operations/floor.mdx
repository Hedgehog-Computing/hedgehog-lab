#### `floor(input: Number | any[] | Mat | Tensor) : Number | any[] | Mat | Tensor[]`

**param** `input` - the construct to find the floor of its numbers, element-wise. 

**returns:** `Number | any[] | Mat | Tensor` - The construct with the elements reflected as their floor values

The floor of a number is the closest INTEGER below that number. For example, the closest integer below 5 is, well, 5. The closest integer below 5.9 is 5. The closest below 6.0001 is 6. And so on. This function takes in a number, list, matrix, Mat or Tensor and finds the floor of all elements and returns the input construct with all the elements now being the floor elements.
