#### `floor(dataIn: number | any[] | Mat | Tensor) : number | any[] | Mat | Tensor`

**param** `dataIn` - the construct to find the floor of its numbers, element-wise. 

**returns:** `number | any[] | Mat | Tensor` - The construct with the elements reflected as their floor values

The floor of a number is the closest **integer** below that number. For example, the closest integer below 5 is, well, 5. The closest integer below 5.9 is 5. The closest below 6.0001 is 6. This function takes in a `number`, list, matrix, `Mat` or `Tensor` and finds the floor of all elements and returns the `dataIn` construct with all the elements now being the floor elements.
