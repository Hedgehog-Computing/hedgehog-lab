#### `normalize(input: any[] | Mat | Tensor) : Mat | Tensor`


**param** `input`- a JS array, matrix or tensor, or a series of number, the construct of data to be normalized

**returns** - `Mat | Tensor` - a matrix or tensor with all the values in the interval [0, 1], normalized

This function simply normalizes the data. It performs normalization on the data whether its in a matrix structure or in a series of numbers. This basically means it takes the values and reduces them to various values in the interval [0,1]. For example, '1,2,3' may be normalized as '0,0.5,1'.
