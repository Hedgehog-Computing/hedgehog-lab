#### `is_missing(input: any[] | Mat | Tensor) : any[] | Mat | Tensor`

**param** `input` - the array, matrix, tensor, etc where you want to find the missing element 

**returns:** `any[] | Mat | Tensor` - The same type and length/size as `input`, where element is 1 if missing, 0 if not.

This function effectively takes your input, which is a matrix, tensor or whatnot, and if it has a missing value in that entry it puts a '1' in it. If it is not a missing value, i.e. a valid or non-missing value, it is a '0'. So you get returned a matrix or tensor or whatever you put in `input` with 0's and 1's, where 1's represent missing elements and 0's otherwise. 

Note that `NaN`, `null`, `''`, `undefined` are defined to be missing and [] and {} are not.

This is useful for getting an array where you know all the locations of the missing elements but not having an effect on them yet.
