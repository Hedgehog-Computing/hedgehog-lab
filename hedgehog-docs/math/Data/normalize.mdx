# `normalize`

Normalizes data, (fits it to [0,1]).

---

## Syntax

#### `normalize(matrix: any[] | Mat | Tensor) : Mat | Tensor`

**param** `matrix`- an `Array`, matrix or `Tensor`, or a series of `number`s (a list), i.e. the construct of data to be normalized

**returns** - `Mat | Tensor` - a `Mat` or `Tensor` with all the values inside normalized to the range [0,1].

---

## Description

This function **normalizes** the data. It performs normalization on the data whether its in a matrix structure or in a series of `number`s. Effectively, it takes the values and reduces them to various values in the interval [0,1]. For example, (1,2,3) would be normalized as (0,0.5,1).
