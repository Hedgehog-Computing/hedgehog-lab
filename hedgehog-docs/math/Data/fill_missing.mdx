# `fill_missing`

What to fill the missing values with and how.

---

## Syntax

#### `fill_missing(matrix: any[] | Mat | Tensor, content: number | any[] | Mat | Tensor, method: string) : any[] | Mat | Tensor`

**param** `matrix` - the data construct to fill the missing entries in  

**param** `content` - what to put in the missing value spot. Can be a `number`, `Array`, `Mat` or `Tensor`. Default is '0'. Note that it can only be an array in certain cases (you can't fill missing list values with an array for example).

**param** `method` - either "constant" or "previous". Constant means using the constant from content. Previous means using the previous value in the input and if no previous value, then use the constant value. Defaults to "constant".

**returns:** `any[] | Mat | Tensor` - copy of the input with the missing values filled

## Description

This function fills the empty entries in an `Array`, `Mat` or `Tensor`. However there are nuances to it. First, you can decide what it fills it with by setting the `content` parameter. Do you want it to put in, say -1's for each missing entry? Or do you want it to put in a 2-D matrix in each missing entry? (You would then have a larger matrix as a return value). There's also the `method` parameter. Do you want to always fill missing entries with `content`? For example, every single missing entry gets filled by `content = -1`? Or do you want to set `method = "previous"` so that the missing entry uses the previous value of `matrix`?

Below are some examples of various usages of the parameters:
