# `smooth`

Smooths data.

## Syntax

#### `smooth(matrix: any[] | Mat | Tensor, dim: number) : any[] | Mat | Tensor`

**param** `matrix` - an `Array`, `Mat` or `Tensor` only supporting 2-D, to smooth the data of. 

**param** `dim` either '0' or '1', '0' for rows, '1' for columns. Default is rows, `dim=0`.  

**returns:** `any[] | Mat | Tensor` - a copy of the input with the elements smoothed.

## Description

This function smooths the data by the following method: 

`a[i] -> (a[i - 2] + a[i - 1] + a[i] + a[i + 1] + a[i + 2]) / 5`

An example to make it clearer is shown below. It's useful for cases where the data is very noisy in large data sets, or where there are many outliers. 

Overall it tries to make the data all "closer" together, or less eratic.
