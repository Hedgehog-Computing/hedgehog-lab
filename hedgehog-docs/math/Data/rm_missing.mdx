#### `rm_missing(matrix: any[] | Mat | Tensor, dim: number) : any[] | Mat | Tensor`

**param** `matrix` - the input to remove the missing values of 

**param** `dim` '0' or '1' : 0 means delete the whole column, 1 means delete the whole row. Default is '0'.

**returns:** `any[] | Mat | Tensor` - returns the corresponding input with missing values removed.

This function takes the input, and deletes the columns (default) or rows (if `dim=1`) that have missing values. Note that this also deletes some valid values in most cases.

Also, note that `null`, `NaN`, `''` and `undefined` are defined to be missing values. `[]` and `{}` are not. 

This is useful when you simply want to remove missing data values and not handle it. This can perhaps be appropriate for a very large `Array` where the missing values are sparse and you dont want to fill it with false values.
