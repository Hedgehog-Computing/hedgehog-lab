# `shape`

Gives the `shape` of the matrix, which is the size of each dimension.

## Syntax

#### `shape(matrix: any[] | Mat | Tensor) : any[]`

**param** `matrix` - The construct you want to find the shape of, should be an `Array`, `Mat` or `Tensor.
 
**returns:** `any[]` - A row vector specifying the shape. And in the row vector, the numbers in each index represent the length of each dimension. For example a return value of [3,4] means the shape of the construct was a 3x4 matrix. A return value of [10] means it has 1 dimension of size 10. That is a list with 10 elements.

## Description

This function gives us the `shape` of various constructs whatever dimensions they have. The shape is a row vector that informs us of the lengths of each dimension of said construct. Another example is if it was a tensor with 5 dimensions, where dimension 1 had 3 rows, dimension 2 had 4 columns, dimension 3 had height 3, dimension 4 had length 2, and dimension 5 had length 4, we would have a shape of [3,4,3,2,4].
