#### `ndim(input: any[] | Mat | Tensor | number) : Number`

**param** `input` - Any JavaScript array, Mat, Tensor or even a number

**returns:** `Number` - The dimension of the structure. 

This function, while small, is quite useful. It determines the dimension of a structure. For example, a vector is 1-dimensional. A 2-d array is 2-dimensional. A 3-d array or 3d tensor is of dimension 3 and so on. A number has dimension 0. Very useful for splitting cases based on dimension type.
