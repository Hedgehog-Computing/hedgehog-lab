#### `is_symmetric(input: any[] | Mat) : boolean`

**param** `input` - Any matrix, two-dimensional and square, to test if it's symmetric or not

**returns:** - `boolean` - True if it is symmetric (recall symmetric means the rows and columns being interchanged doesn't affect the matrix), false otherwise

This function tests if a square 2d matrix is symmetric or not. One way to visually check is look at the diagonal - if the elements are symmetric across that, it is symmetric.
