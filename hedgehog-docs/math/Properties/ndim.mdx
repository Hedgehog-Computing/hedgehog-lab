#### `ndim(dataIn: any[] | Mat | Tensor | number) : number`

**param** `dataIn` - an `Array`, `Mat` or `Tensor` or even a `number`.

**returns:** `number` - Representing the dimension of the structure. 

This function is quite useful as it can handle different cases when size matters. It determines the number of dimensions of a structure. For example, a vector is 1 dimensional. A 2-D array is 2 dimensional. A 3-D `Array` or 3-D `Tensor` has 3 dimensions and so on. A `number` has 0 dimensions.

Note that this is returning the **number** of dimensions, not the dimensions themselves. So for a matrix of size 3x4, it has 2 dimensions - rows and columns. Thus `ndim=2`, the size of 3x4 doesn't matter in this function.
