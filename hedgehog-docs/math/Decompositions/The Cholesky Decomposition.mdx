#### `cholesky(input: any[] | Mat) : any[]`

**param** `input` - The matrix to decompose using the cholesky method. Needs to be symmetric (hermitian) and positive definite (if the number z^T*M*z > 0 for every non-zero column vector z for M=input, but that's not what we're concerned with).

**returns:** `any[]` - The matrix `L` from the decomposition `L*L^T = input`

This function decomposes a positive definite, symmetric (hermitian) matrix using the cholesky method. It returns the `L` part of the decomposition, `L*L^T = A` where `A` would be the input. If the input is not positive definite you will have a exception thrown.
