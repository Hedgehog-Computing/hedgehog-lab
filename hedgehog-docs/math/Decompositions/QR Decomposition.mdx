#### `QR(input: any[] | Mat) : any[]`

**param** `input` - The matrix to be decomposed using the QR method. Needs to be a square matrix.

**returns:** `any[]` - The matrix `Q` and `R` from the decomposition. 

This function decomposes a square matrix using the QR method, where Q is an orthogonal matrix and R is an upper triangular matrix. Recall that an orthogonal matrix is one where the rows and columns are orthonormal vectors which is satisfied by Q^TxQ = QxQ^T = I, where I is identity). Knowing when one decomposition is better than the other is key to saving time and being efficient with data.

**Note** Please use QR and not qr. It is capital case for the time being.
