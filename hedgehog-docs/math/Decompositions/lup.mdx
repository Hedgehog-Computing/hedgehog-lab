# `lup`

Decomposes a matrix using the LU method.

---

## Syntax

#### `lup(matrix: any[] | Mat) : any[]`

**param** `matrix` - The matrix to be decomposed using the LU method. Needs to be a square matrix.

**returns:** `any[]` - The matrix `L` , `U` and the column vector `p` from the decomposition. 

---

## Description

This function decomposes a square matrix using the LU decomposition method. It returns a lower triangular matrix (L), an upper triangular matrix (U), and pivot (p). Note that these can be access by calling `{result}.L, {result}.U, {result}.p` as we'll see in the following example. This is because the return value is an object with members L, U and p.
