# Arrow Function Expressions

Arrow functions are a different way to write functions - they are more compact, but slightly more limited.

Here are some key differences:


- Arrow functions should not be used as `methods` since they do not have their own bindings to `this`, `arguments` or `super`.

- Arrow functions can't use the keyword `new.target`. 

- Arrow functions can't use `call`, `apply` and `bind` methods. 

- Arrow functions can't be used as `constructors`. 

- Arrow functions can't use `yield` in it's body. 


Let's have an example comparing the syntax of normal function declaration versus arrow functions:

    width="100%"

:::note
When there exists multiple (or 0) arguments, one must wrap the arguments in parentheses.

An important syntax requirement of arrow functions is to wrap the function body if there are more than 1 statements:

<iframe
    src="https://hlab.app/s/docs/afunc2_hbook"
    width="100%"
    height="400px"/>

Overall the steps to creating an arrow function given a function are:

- 1) Remove the word `function` and place arrows between the arguments first body bracket

- 2) Remove the body brackets (unless there's additional lines of processing) and remove the word `return`

- 3) Remove the argument's parantheses (unless theres multiple or none such as in an anonymous function).

Arrow functions are important to understand primarily because so many people use them! 

It can be quite confusing to read someone's code if you don't understand arrow functions.

The other benefit is that it's very compact and effective in certain situations.
