# Arguments Object

In functions, there are values that are passed in called **arguments**. The **arguments** are passed into **parameters**. 

Hence, one can think of arguments as realized parameters through function calls.

The `arguments` object contains all arguments in an `array` format. Thus, `Array` methods can be utilized.

Here is a simple example:

<iframe
    src="https://hlab.app/s/docs/argument_hbook"
    width="100%"
    height="300px"/>

The arguments object here is simply getting printed for each value.

:::note
One can find the size or amount of arguments via `arguments.length`
:::

An important fact and example is the argument objects can be variable in size. 

That is, the function is defined so the user can enter 0, 2, 3, or more variables.

Here is an example, and how to implement functions for such cases:

<iframe
    src="https://hlab.app/s/docs/argsex1_hbook"
    width="100%"
    height="400px"/>

:::note
`arguments[]` start at index 0 just like everything else in Hedgehog Script

Also, `...params` is how you create a variable amount of arguments: this will be covered in the chapter "Parameters".
:::

One last example is changing an `argument`:

<iframe
    src="https://hlab.app/s/docs/argsex2_hbook"
    width="100%"
    height="400px"/>

Overall, the `arguments` object is similar to an `Array`. `arguments` themselves are realized parameters during function calls. 

Hopefully one will run into many cases where using the `arguments` object is helpful, as there are many use cases.
