#  Functions

- A function is effectively a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. 

    - The input and output typically have a relationship.

## Create a Function

To create your own function in Hedgehog Script you can use the syntax:

```js 
function {function_name}({parameter1}, {parameter2}, ... ) { {function_code} }
```

:::tip
It is encouraged to use 'camelCase' in Hedgehog Script. 

This means every word (except the first) starts with an uppercase letter, and there is always nothing in between words.

An example is as follows: `thisIsAFunctionWithCamelCase5(...parameters) { //code }`
:::

Let's make a function. All we need to provide is a name for the function and code for the body:

<iframe

    width="100%"
    height="450px"/>

:::info

The function `toFixed(numDigits)` can be called on numerical expressions, limiting the decimals displayed

**Functions are the main driver of code!** 

One writes functions so you they reuse code blocks.

- Or, to use them with variations through parameters or other changes. 

:::tip
Functions are extremely important!
