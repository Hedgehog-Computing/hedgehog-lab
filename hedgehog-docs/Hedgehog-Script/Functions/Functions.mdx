#  Functions

Functions are generally vast in terms of information about them, and they're crucial to learn for Hedgehog Script or **any programming language**. 

## Create a Function

To create your own function in Hedgehog Script you can use the syntax:

`function {function_name}({parameter1}, {parameter2}, ... ) { {//_function_code_//} }`

As an example, let's create a very simple function. All we need to provide is a name for the function and code for the body:

:::tip
It is encouraged to use 'camelCase' in Hedgehog Script. 

This implies every word (except the first) starts with an uppercase letter, and there is always nothing in between words.

An example is as follows: `thisIsAFunctionWithCamelCase5(...parameters) { }`

:::note

The function `toFixed(numDigits)` can be called on numerical expressions, limiting the digits displayed

**Functions are the main driver of code.** You write functions so you can reuse code blocks, or use them with variations through parameters or other changes. 

Functions are extremely important, so if one wishes, here is a link to more information: [Functions - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions)
