# Method Definitions

Method definitions have a shorter syntax for defining a function method.

Here is an example of the syntax, given normal code:

<iframe
    src="https://hlab.app/s/docs/methoddef2_hbook"
    width="100%"
    height="700px"/>


:::tip

Simply create methods by doing this: 
- write the name of the method follow by parameters if any, then a curly bracket which wraps the method's body!

:::


Overall, there's not much more to method definitions and we've learned the standard way.

The more flexibility the better!
