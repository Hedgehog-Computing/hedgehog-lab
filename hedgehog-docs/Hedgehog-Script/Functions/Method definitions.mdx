# Method Definitions

Method definitions have a shorter syntax for defining a function method.

Here is an example of the syntax given normal code:

    width="100%"
    height="700px"/>


:::tip

Simply create methods by doing this: write the name of the function follow by parameters if any, then a curly bracket which wraps the method's body!

Overall, there's not much to method definitions as we've already learned the standard way, and this is a shorter way.

The more flexibility the better!
