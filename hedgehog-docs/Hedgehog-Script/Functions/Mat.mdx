# The Mat Object

The `Mat` Object is very useful for matrix-like operations in Hedgehog Script. It can be 1 dimensional, 2d, 3d and so on. 

To declare one, it's like declaring an instance of a Hedgehog Script `object` (by using the `new` keyword).

Here is a very simple example:

Don't forget to use `( )` to construct it!

:::info

When constructing a `Mat`, always have at least 2 layers of brackets. Something like `new Mat([1,2,3,4])` is forbidden.

### We support many functions for matrices ...

Basic summation, multiplication, elementwise-operations, decompositions, processing data and much more, it's all there, built-in, easy to use.

However, those functions are located in the "Math" book (top navigation bar). In this section we simply give the basics.

Here are the fundamental properties of `Mat` objects:

`rows`, `cols`, `val`. Sub-properties include: `val.length`, `val[0].length`. 

There are vital for operating around a matrix. From loops, to boundaries to the most important - values (`val`).

:::tip

Use the property `val` to transform a `Mat` into a raw `Array`:

`myMat_raw = myMat.val;`

Typical `Array` functions can now be performed on `myMat_raw`.

All built in functions for Hedgehog Lab work for `Arrays`, `Tensor` objects and `Mat` objects. However, if you only have a normal `Array` you are limited to Hedgehog Script `Array` libraries. 

Here are some examples of using `Mat` or its counterpart in a function:

:::note

One can use '\n' in strings to add newlines.

Overall, the `Mat` is a useful object in Hedgehog Script designed for matrix functions and operations. It can even model tensors.
