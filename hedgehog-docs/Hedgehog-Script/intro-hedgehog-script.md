# Introduction


### Overview

- **Hedgehog Script** is a **JavaScript**-like programming language;

- **Functional Programming(FP)** and **Object-Oriented Programming(OOP)** are supported;

- **Operator overload** for Matrix and Symbolic Computing are supported (just like **Matlab**);

- **No package installation**. Import any package(s) inside code without pre-processing;

- **Everything is inside your browser**. No terminal, no local environment. Coding and running in your browser locally.


### Topics

The topics we've selected are based on what is most common and useful for starting to write in Hedgehog Script. 

The left hand sidebar shows the topics. Namely:

Here are the basic topics we've selected: 

- [Expression & Operators](/Expressions%20%26%20Operators/Expressions%20%26%20Operators.md)
- [Statements & Declarations](/Statements%20and%20Declarations/Declarations.mdx)
- [Built-In Objects](/Built-In%20Objects/Basic%20Types.mdx)
- [Functions](/Functions/Functions.mdx)
- [Classes](/Classes/Classes.mdx)

- Within each topic will be chapters discussing specific things related to the topic

**Let's first start with the classic example:**


Use theÂ `print()` function to print `"Hello world"` string in Hedgehog Lab:


  <iframe
    src="https://hlab.app/s/docs/helloworld_hbook"
    width="100%"
    height="300px"
  ></iframe>


Do you see the output `"Hello world"`? Congratulations! Your first Hedgehog Script runs successfully!
