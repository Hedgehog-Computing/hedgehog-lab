# Introduction


## Getting Started

Firstly, the major thing to understand is that you need to write and learn JavaScript/TypeScript in order to effectively utilize Hedgehog Script. Everything will be written in such.

## Topics

The topics we'll cover are basic JavaScript topics that you'll use while writing in Hedgehog Script. The left hand sidebar shows the topics.
Namely - the topics will be Built-in Objects, Expressions & Operators, Statements & Declarations, Functions, Classes and lastly, Errors. Within each will be several topics.  


Let's first start with the classic example:



Use theÂ `print()` function to print `"Hello world"` string in Hedgehog Lab:


  <iframe
    src="https://hlab.app/s/docs/helloworld_hbook"
    width="100%"
    height="500px"
  ></iframe>


Do you see the output `"Hello world"`? Congratulations! Your first Hedgehog Script runs successfully!

Try it yourself, by changing the code and executing it in browser!
