# Introduction

:::info

Thank you for considering Hedgehog Lab using Hedgehog Script! 

- We're always glad to have more members of the community.

This book is all about how to start programming in Hedgehog Lab.
:::
## Getting Started

Firstly, the goal is to understand how to read, write and learn Hedgehog Script in order to effectively Hedgehog Lab.

### Topics

The topics we've selected are based on what is most common and useful for starting to write in Hedgehog Script. 

The left hand sidebar shows the topics. Namely:
- Expressions & Operators, Statements & Declarations, Built-in Objects, Functions and lastly, Classes.

  - Within each topic will be chapters discussing specific things related to the topic

**Let's first start with the classic example:**



Use theÂ `print()` function to print `"Hello world"` string in Hedgehog Lab:


  <iframe
    src="https://hlab.app/s/docs/helloworld_hbook"
    width="100%"
    height="300px"
  ></iframe>


Do you see the output `"Hello world"`? Congratulations! Your first Hedgehog Script runs successfully!
