# `this`

The keyword `this` belongs to functions, (or when used alone, the global `object`).

`this` is effectively a pointer to that `function`/`object`.

Here is an example:

<iframe
    src="https://hlab.app/s/docs/thisex1_hbook"
    width="100%"
    height="500px"/>


There are different contexts of using `this`:

- Global context: when `this` is called outside of a function, it refers to the global object. (window in a browser for example)

- Function context: calling `this` in a function refers to the object the function belongs to. 

    - If said function is alone, this refers globally.

- Class context: refers to the properties/members of that class in an instance of it

:::info

We can change what `this` refers to, especially in function contexts, using `binding` methods (shown soon).

Here's another example of `this` used in an `object` setting:

### Binding this

We can change what `this` refers to by using certain methods:

- `bind()` can set a function's `this` value. Note that arrow functions don't have their own `this` binding

- `call()` will bind a function's `this` to the first parameter put in `call()`

- `apply()` similar to `call()`

Let's see an example:

<iframe
    src="https://hlab.app/s/docs/this_hbook"
    width="100%"
    height="400px"/>

Regarding the `bind()` method, a function calls `bind()` with an `object` parameter.

This leads to a creation of a new, equal function.

- `this` will then be bound permanently in the new function to said parameter.

Let's see another example to clarify:

<iframe
    src="https://hlab.app/s/docs/thisex3_hbook"
    width="100%"
    height="500px"/>
