# Return Statements

The `return` statement is relatively simple and familiar. It ends function execution, absolutely, when executed. 

It also can store a value, to be 'returned'

Here is a very simple, brief example:

- The syntax of a `return` statement is very simple: `return [expression];`.
- If `[expression]` is omitted, `undefined` is returned instead.

**Automatic Semicolon Insertion**: not too important, but good to understand: 

Did you not place a semi-colon (;) after a `return [expression]` statement? 

Good news, it's automatically inserted for you.

But the downside is... if you had code executed **after** the `return` statement, it is unreachable, and the function will end 'prematurely'.

Here is an example as well as a remedy for it:

A useful case of `return;` is when you want to **intentionally** interrupt a function within some point in the control flow.

Here is a simple example on how to do so:

If one isn't aware of what's going on with the expression `${count}A`, here's a quick explanation (and useful for the future):

This is a **template literal** performing **string interpolation**. The `$` is a delimiter as well as the backticks surrounding the expression. 

So in simple terms, wrap your whole expression with ` `` ` and wrap your [expression] (===count here) with `{}`s prefixed by $. It will now be 'evaluated' or 'computed'. The 'A' at the end literally just adds an A as a suffix to the result.

One more useful feature of `return` statements is not to return a value, but rather a **function**:

- Overall, this is a review of `return` statements, and one needs to acknowledge that `return` completely ends function execution when called. 

- No expression to `return`? `unidentified` is the result. 

- Other than for typical use, `return` can be used for - interrupting a function and returning functions ( among other techniques ).
