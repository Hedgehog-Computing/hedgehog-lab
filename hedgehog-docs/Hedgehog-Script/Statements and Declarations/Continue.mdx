# `continue`

A `continue` statement stops the execution of the statements within the current **iteration** of a loop. 

Then it **resumes** or "continues" at the next iteration. 

Basically, `continue` skips a loop iteration when it is called, perhaps under a conditional.

Here is a simple example:

<iframe

    width="100%"
    height="400px"/>

`Continue` can optionally be used with the `label` identifier:


- This will make control-flow redirect to a **labeled** loop statement instead of the current loop. 

    -  `continue` needs to be nested within the labeled statement. 

Here is an example comparing two different versions of a function:

    width="100%"
    height="700px"/>

:::note

The difference between `break` and `continue` is this:
- `continue` ends the current iteration and moves to the next or the `label`.

- However, `break` simply exits the entire loop itself.

:::tip
Overall, it's good to understand `continue` in relation to `break`.

It's also important to use `labels`! They completely change control-flow in a way sometimes not possible through typical means.
