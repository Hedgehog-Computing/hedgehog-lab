# Switch Statement

The `switch` statement is a sometimes useful conditional-like statement. 

What it does is - evaluates an expression, matches the evaluated value against `case` clauses, and executes statements if a case is matching.

It's typical to add `breaks` in most cases: it ends the statement after executing the `case` instructions.

:::tip

There is a `default` clause that a `switch case` statement can fall back on if defined: if nothing is matched to a `case`, the `default case` is executed.

Let's view a simple example of what we've said so far:

The syntax is very brief and simple for `switch` statements:

```js
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        //statements executed when expression matches value1
        [break;]
    case value2:
        //statements executed when expression matches value2
        [break;]
    ...
    case valueN:
        //statements executed when expression matches valueN
        [break;]
    [default:
        //statements executed when no value matches the expression
        [break;]]
}
// NOTE: [] -> optional
```


Why are the `breaks` optional? If one wishes the expression to 'fall-through' the `cases` - just don't add `breaks`. 

Also, `default` is optional like previously mentioned. 

Let's view an example to understand what 'fall-through' means: 

:::tip
`default` cases don't have to be at the end! 

If in the middle, perhaps the `default` case will be hit before any case is (hence ignoring below cases if theres a `break` in `default`).

- Why use a `switch` statement when `if...else if... else if` chains exist? Simply put, there is fall-through behavior which is useful in some cases.


- Overall, a `switch` statement can be thought of as an alternative to `if...else if` chains with sometimes benefits, sometimes drawbacks. The main benefits are fall-through behavior and use of identity comparisons instead of equality (=== vs ==). 

- Lastly, remember to use the `default` case in a powerful manner: it doesn't have to be at the bottom, it can be in between cases.
