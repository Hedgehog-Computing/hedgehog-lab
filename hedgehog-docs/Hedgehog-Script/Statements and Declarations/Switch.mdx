# Switch Statement

The `switch` statement is a sometimes useful conditional-like statement. 

What it does is it evaluates an expression, then compares said expression to case values **in order**.

-  When a case is matched, it will execute the case statements

It's typical to add `breaks` in most cases: it ends the `switch` statement after executing the `case` instructions.

:::tip

- There is a `default` clause that a `switch case` statement can fall back on if defined: 

    - if nothing is matched to a `case`, the `default case` is executed.

Let's see an example of a `switch` statement with a `default case`:

The syntax for `switch` statements is:

```js
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        //statements executed when expression matches value1
        [break;]
    case value2:
        //statements executed when expression matches value2
        [break;]
    ...
    case valueN:
        //statements executed when expression matches valueN
        [break;]
    [default:
        //statements executed when no value matches the expression
        [break;]]
}
// NOTE: [] -> optional
```


Why are the `breaks` optional? If one wishes the expression to 'fall-through' the `cases` - just don't add `breaks`. 

Also, `default` is optional like previously mentioned. 

Let's view an example to understand what 'fall-through' means:

`default` cases don't necessarily have to be at the end!

- Why use a `switch` statement when `if...else if... else if` chains exist? 

    - Simply put, there is fall-through behavior which is useful in some cases.


- Overall, a `switch` statement can be thought of as an alternative to `if...else if` chains. 

    - The main benefit is fall-through behavior
