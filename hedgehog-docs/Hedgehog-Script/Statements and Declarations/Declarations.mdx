# Declarations

A declaration is a formal or explicit announcement of an identifier's meaning.

Some declarations are `let`, `const`, `function` and `class`.

---


### `let`

`let` is a declaration for a block-scoped local variable. 

- Within the declaration you can optionally initialize it to a value

An example is:

`let a;` or, 

`let b = 6;`

:::warning

It's important to mention immediately: do **not** use `var`. Use `let` every time! 

`var` can leak into other code. It's dangerous and bad practice.
:::

Here is a simple, easy example using `let`:

:::info

A type is not required in a declaration in Hedgehog Script. It is a dynamic language.

:::

- The declaration is block-scoped and local. 

    - In the example above, the declaration `let x = 2;` dissolves after the `if` conditional.

- If used in a loop, the variable declared by `let` would dissolve after the loop.

Let's show an example of this concept:

### `const` 

A declaration using `const` is quite similar to `let`.

The difference is that `const` variables can't be redeclared or reassigned.

`const` also has a block scope.

Here is an example displaying the difference:

    width="100%"

### `function`

Using the identifier `function` lets one declare a function.

Unlike a variable, one must initialize a function's parameters and code statements in Hedgehog Script:

    src="https://hlab.app/s/docs/funcdeclarationex_hbook"
    width="100%"
    height="500px" />

:::info

In the example above, the parameters are numbers then strings!

That's because Hedgehog Script is dynamically typed.

### `class`

Just like a `function` declaration, one uses `class` declarations in a similar way.

Some additional things classes can do (functions can too in some cases, but it's messy) are:

- Classes can be redeclared

- Class names are optional

Here is an example displaying the variety of class declarations:

    height="800px" />
