# Break Statements

The `break` statement is quite simple - it ends the current loop/switch and transfers program control to the statement proceeding the loop.

Here is a simple example:

:::warning

The reason `break` was replaced with the `print(...)` statement is because `break` is **not allowed**.

That is because `break` is a **statement**. Conditional tertiary operator (?) only can return **expressions**.

Lastly, the other important statement that's effectively the closest to `break` (but performs a distinctly different operation) is calleed `continue`, which you can find in this section, and it's important to understand when to use each, as breaking from loops under extra conditions can be quite useful.
