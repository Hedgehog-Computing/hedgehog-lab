# Break

The `break` statement is a control-flow statement:
- `break` ends the current loop/switch and transfers program control to the statement proceeding the loop.

Here is an example:

:::info

`break` is a **statement**. And statements have some limitations.

For example, the ternary operator `?` can't call `break` as it only allows expressions to be returned.

It's good to also know what `continue` means. 

`break` and `continue` can be used for different situations.
