# Import

The `import` declaration is used to import bindings which are exported by another module. 

If you have a module with an `export` declaration, then one can `import` it to the current module and use it there. 

For source file import declarations, one must have the source file be interpreted as a module.
s
- To do so , use the dynamic `import` call. 

Here are some brief examples on importing a module - recall that the imported module must have an export declaration:


- `import` * as first from "mod1"; 

- `import` (export1) from "module-name"; 

- `import` (export1 as alias1) from "module-name"; 

- `import` defaultExport from "module-name"; 

- `import` "module-name"; 

- `import` (export1, export2) from "module-name"; 

:::info
- `defaultExport` refers to the name that is referred to as the default export from the module. 

- `module-name` is the module to import from.
:::

Note that imports declarations must also be present in modules and only at the highest level.

:::caution
The top two things to know are: 

- to import something, that something needs to have a line declaring that its exporting

- use the following for math functions from our math library: 

    - `*import math:functionNameInMath;`
:::

- There are effectively four forms of `import` declarations:


- Named import: `import {export1, export2} from "module-name";`

- Default import: `import defaultExport from "module-name";`

- Namespace import: `import * as name from "module-name';`

- Side effect import: `import "module-name";`


Here is a clear example in Hedgehog Script using import to import math libraries like mentioned:

:::note
The math can be ignored, one should understand the import statements however
