#  Control Flow

Control flow is all about the **order of execution**. 

Whether it be a statement, instruction, or function call, control flow is responsible for it's execution and in what order.

Since programming languages and programs have evolved past the assembly programming level, executions no longer needs to be so rigid relative to the line number.

We can now have a massive variety of ways to change control flow and handle what gets executed when. We'll cover the basics in this section.

:::info
Assembly and even Maching Level Programming even had control-flow! They both effectively use labels. It's done through an intruction pointer register - contains the addresss of the next instruction to be executed and can be modified by programmer sometimes. 
:::

"Block statements" are almost always paired with control flow statements - they are blocks delimited by `{}`. Examples include `if`, `for` or `while`, etc.

The syntax is as follows:

` (optionalStatement) {
    StatementList
  }`

## if-else statement

`if (condition) {` <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`statementsExecutedIfTrue` <br />
 `}`
 `else {` <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`statementsExecutedOtherwise`<br />
 `}`


Use `if-else` statements when you need to execute binary control-flow. 

That is go direction A if (`condition === true`) and go direction B if (`condition === false`).

:::tip

When writing a `if-else` statement, you don't need the `else` statement all the time! It is implicitly there if the only control flow is an `if()`. 

That's because if `if()` fails, everything you write after `if()` will be executed!
:::

As for more directions, say C and D and E... use a `if-else if-else if....-else(optional)`.

Here is an example of a simple `if-else` statement:

And here is an example of a little more complicated statement (including `else-if` and `else`):

## For statement
A `for` loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to `false`. The Hedgehog Script `for`-loop statement looks as follows: 

```
for ([initialExpression]; [condition]; [incrementExpression]) { 
  statement }
```
Here is an example:

## while and do-while statement
The `while` statement creates a loop that executes a specified statement as long as the test condition evaluates to `true`. The condition is evaluated *before* executing the statement.

Here is the syntax for `while` statement:
```
while (condition) {
  statement }
```

The `do...while` statement creates a loop that executes a specified statement until the test condition evaluates to `false`. The condition is evaluated *after* executing the statement, resulting in the specified statement executing _at least once_.

Here is the syntax for `do...while` statement:
```
do {
   statement }
while (condition);
```
Here are examples for `while` and `do...while` statements in Hedgehog Script performing the same function:

:::info
These are the basic, fundamental ways to control the logical flow of your script/program using Hedgehog Script. It's quite important to learn them all by:
- frequently using them
- using a variety
- trying to learn new control flow methods

Those skills translate to **any** language.
