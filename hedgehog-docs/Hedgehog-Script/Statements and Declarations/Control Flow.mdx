#  Control Flow

Control flow is all about the **order of execution**. 

Whether it be a statement, instruction, or function call, control flow handles the order of execution.

Let's cover some basics in this section:


- "Block statements" are almost always paired with control flow statements - they are blocks delimited by `{}`

  - Examples include `if`, `for` or `while`, etc.

The syntax is as follows:

` (someControlFlowStatement) {
    StatementList
  }`

## if-else statement

`if (condition) {` <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`statementsExecutedIfTrue` <br />
 `}`
 `else {` <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`statementsExecutedOtherwise`<br />
 `}`


Use `if-else` statements when you need to execute binary control-flow. 

That is go direction A if (`condition === true`) and go direction B if (`condition === false`).

:::tip

When writing a `if-else` statement, you don't need the `else` statement all the time! It is implicitly there if the only control flow is an `if()`. 

That's because if `if()` fails, everything you write after `if()` will be executed!
:::

As for more directions, say C and D and E... use a `if-else if-else if....-else(optional)` control flow.

Here is an example of a simple `if-else` statement:

And here is an example of using `if...else if...else`:

## For statement
A `for` loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to `false`. 

The Hedgehog Script `for`-loop statement looks as follows: 

```
for ([initialExpression]; [condition]; [incrementExpression]) { 
  statementList }
```
Here is an example:

## while and do-while statement
The `while` statement creates a loop that executes a specified statement as long as the test condition evaluates to `true`. 

The condition is evaluated *before* executing the statement.

Here is the syntax for `while` statement:
```
while (condition) {
  statement }
```

The `do...while` statement creates a loop that executes a specified statement until the test condition evaluates to `false`.

The condition is evaluated *after* executing the statement, resulting in the specified statement executing **at least once**.

Here is the syntax for `do...while` statement:
```
do {
   statement }
while (condition);
```
Here are examples for `while` and `do...while` statements in Hedgehog Script performing the same function:

:::info
These are the basic, fundamental ways to control the logical flow of your script/program using Hedgehog Script. It's quite important to learn them all by:
- frequently using them

- using a variety

- trying to learn new control flow methods

Those skills translate to **any** language.
