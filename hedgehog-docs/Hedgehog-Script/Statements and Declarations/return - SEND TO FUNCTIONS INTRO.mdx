# `return`

The `return` statement completely ends function execution.

It also can store a value, to be 'returned' from a function.

Here's an example:

- The syntax of a `return` statement is: `return [expression];`

- If `[expression]` is omitted, `undefined` is returned instead


:::info
**Automatic Semicolon Insertion**: 

Did you not place a semi-colon (;) after a `return [expression]` statement? 

Good news, it's automatically inserted for you.

But the downside is... if you had code executed **after** the `return` statement, it is unreachable now.

Here is an example as well as a remedy for it:

:::tip

A useful case of `return;` is when you want to **intentionally** interrupt a function within some point in the control flow.

The following is an example of it:

If one isn't aware of what's going on with the expression `${count}A`, here is how it works:

This is a **template literal** performing **string interpolation**. 

- The `$` is a delimiter as well as the backticks surrounding the expression. 

In other words; wrap your whole expression with ` `` ` and wrap the expression to be evaluated with `{}`s prefixed by $. 

- It will now be 'evaluated' or 'computed'. The 'A' at the end just adds an A as a suffix to the result.

One more useful feature of `return` statements is not to return a value, but rather a **function**:
