# Let Statement

`Let` is an extremely important and commonly used declaration. 

It is for declaring a a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.


:::warning

We'll mention it immediately: do **not** use `var`. Use `let` every time! 

`Var` can leak into other code. It's dangerous and bad practice.

Here is a simple, easy example using `let`:

<iframe
    src="https://hlab.app/s/docs/let_hbook"
    width="100%"
    height="350px" />

- As mentioned, the declaration is block-scoped. Thus 'x' only applies within the `if-conditional`

- If it was within a `for-loop`, a `let` variable will disappear after the loop executes fully

Let's show an example of one of the above:

    height="500px" />
