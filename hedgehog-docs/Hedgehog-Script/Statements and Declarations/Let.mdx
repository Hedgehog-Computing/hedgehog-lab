# Let Statement

`Let` is an extremely important and commonly used declaration. It is for declaring a a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.


:::warning

We'll mention it immediately: do **not** use `var`. Use `let` every time! 

`Var` can leak into connected files. It's dangerous and bad practice.

Here is a simple, easy example using `let`:

<iframe

    width="100%"
    height="350px" />

- As mentioned, the difference is: the declaration is block-scoped. So it only applies within the `if-conditional`. 

- If it was within a `for-loop`, `let varName;` will disappear when the loops ends, etc. 

- `let` is unlike `var`, where `var` declares a variable globally, or locally to an entire function. 

- Use `let`. **Don't** use `var` ever. It's good practice.

- One other difference is that regarding the top level of programs and functions `let`, unlike `var` doesn't create a property on the global object

Let's show an example of one of the above:

In general, `let` is very much preferable to `var` and we actually advise agaqinst ever using `var`.
