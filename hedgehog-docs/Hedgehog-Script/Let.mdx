# Let Statement

`Let` is an extremely important and commonly used declaration. It is for declaring a a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

Here is some examples:

```js
let x = 1;

if (x === 1) {
    let x = 2;
    //expected output of print(x): 2
}

//expected output of print(x): 1
```
Why the difference? Well as mentioned before, the declaration is block-scoped. Hence it only applies and holds its value within the `if-coonditional`. If it was within a for loop it would stop holding true when the loops ends, etc. 

`let` is unlike `var`, where `var` declares a variable globally or locally to an entire function. 

It is good practice to declare `let` variables at the top of the scope. That is because some issues can occur if they aren't.

Another difference is that at the top level of programs and functions `let`, unlike `var` doesn't create a property on the global object:

```js
var x = 'global';
let y = 'global2';
console.log(this.x) // --> "global"
console.log(this.y) // ---> undefined
```

In general, `let` is very much preferable to `var` and we actually advise agaqinst ever using `var`.
