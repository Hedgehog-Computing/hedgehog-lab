#  Arrays

The Array in Hedgehog Script is quite similar to the one in JavaScript.
 

You can create and print an array:

<iframe src="https://hlab.app/s/docs/array1_hbook"
width="100%"
    height="250px"
    title="what4"
  ></iframe>


You can add or remove items from an array:

<iframe src="https://hlab.app/s/docs/array2_hbook"
width="100%"
    height="500px"
    title="what5"
  ></iframe>





You can iterate over an array:

<iframe src="https://hlab.app/s/docs/array3_hbook"
width="100%"
    height="600px"
    title="what6"
  ></iframe>


For the use of arrow functions in this example, if you're not familiar with the concept, this is a good reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions 


And much more as we'll see later.
