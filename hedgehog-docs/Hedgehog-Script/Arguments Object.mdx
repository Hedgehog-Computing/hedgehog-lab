# Arguments Object

When you create a function, there are values that need to get passed in called **parameters**. When these parameters are realized through a function call they are then **arguments**. The arguments object is an object that is Array-like and it contains the values of the arguments passed to that function.

Here is a simple example:

```js
function myFunction(arg1, arg2) {
    print('arg1 is: '+ arguments[0]);
    print('arg2 is: '+ arguments[1]);
}
```

The arguments object here is being used to access the two arguments of `myFunction`, and simply prints it. Hence, when you do a function call...

```js
myFunction(3,50);
```

then the arguments object is initialized to have it's first slot as `3` and it's second as `50`. And the output would be:

```js
3 50
```

as calling the function makes it print the arguments passed by the function caller. 

One note is similar to an array, the length of the argument object i.e. the number of arguments can be found by calling `arguments.length`.

An important example for using the arguments object in a real setting is counting the number of arguments when they can vary. For example suppose you have a function that performs operations based on the 3 arguments inputted. What happens if the user only inputs two? Maybe a different operation needs to occur. Or you can have the same operation occur for any amount of arguments by creating a for loop with the header being `for (let i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) { ... }`

Overall, the arguments object can be accessed similar to an array to access the individual arguments. These are parameters that are realized during a function call. Soon enough, you will run into cases when you need to either perform different operations based on the number of arguments, change an argument to a new values `(arguments[1] = 'new value')`, or loop through the variable number of arguments doing an operation.
