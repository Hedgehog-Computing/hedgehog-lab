# Imports

The `import` declaration (static) is used to import bindings which are exported by another module. So if you have a certain module with the export declaration, then one can `import` it to the current module and use it there. The imported bindings are called live bindings because they are updated by the module that exported the binding, and can't be modified by the importing module (making it read only).

For a source file import declaration, one must have the file be interpreted as a module by the runtime. In HTML, one can do this by adding `type="module"` to the `<script>` tag. On the other hand, one can use the function-like dynamic `import()` which doesn't need scripts of `type="module"`.

Here are some brief examples on importing a module - recall that the imported module must have an export declaration:

```js
import * as first from "mod1";
import {export1} from "module-name";
import {export1 as alias1} from "module-name";
import defaultExport from "module-name";
import "module-name"
import {export1, export2} from "module-name";
//and several other varieties...
```

`defaultExport` refers to the name that refers to the default export from the module. 
`module-name` is the module to import from. Note that in Node, extension-less imports mostly refer to packages in `node_modules`.

`import` declarations must also be present in modules and only at the highest level (not inside blocks or functions, etc). 

There are effectively four forms of `import` declarations:
<ul>
<li> Named import: `import {export1, export2} from "module-name";` </li>
<li> Default import: `import defaultExport from "module-name";`</li>
<li> Namespace import: `import * as name from "module-name';`</li>
<li> Side effect import: `import "module-name";`</li>
</ul>

Here are some clear examples of each, supposing we have a module called `my-module` with a value of `myExport` which has been exported from `my-module`:

```js
//named import:
import {myExport} from '/modules/my-module.js';
//or ...
import {first, second} from '/modules/my-module.js'
// or renaming the export when importing:
import { reallylongmoduleexportnae as newName} from 'modules/my-modules.js';


//default import: 
import myDefault from '/modules/my-modules.js';
//can also declare default import with namespace or named imports:
import myDefault, * as myModule from 'modules/my-modules.js';
import myDefault, as {foo, bar} from 'modules/my-modules.js';

//namespace import:
import * as myModule from '/modules/my-modules.js';
// then you can invoke other exported things :
myModule.doSomething();

//side effect import
import 'modules/my-modules.js';
//this example above exports the whole globql code of the module for use
