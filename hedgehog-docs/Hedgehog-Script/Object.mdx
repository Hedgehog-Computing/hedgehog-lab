# Object

`Object` is a type. Similar to how `String` is a type. It is a data type used for storing various keyed collections and more complex things. They can be create using `Object()` or the object initializer/literal syntax. `Object` is quite important as almost all JavaScript objects are instances of `Object`. It's effectively the top-level object. If one changes the `Object` prototype object, all objects will be affected via prototype chaining - unless the properties and methods regarding those changes are overriden further along the prototype chain. This is a very powerful but **dangerous** mechanism to override/extend object behavior.

Let's discuss the constructor for `Object`: 
<ul>
<li> If the value of the input type is null or undefined, it will create and return an empty object. </li>
<li> If the value is an object already, it will return the value (the object) itself. </li>
<li> Otherwise, the constructor will return an object of a type that corresponds to the given value. </li>
</ul>

Regarding deletion of a property from an object, there isn't any method to delete `Object` properties like `Map` has `Map.prototype.delete()` for example. Rather, one must use the delete operator. 

There are quite a few methods, static or instance, for `Object`. Let's point out 7 of them:
<ul>
<li> Object() - the constructor, takes the input and makes it an object. </li>
<li> (static) Object.entries() - returns an array with all [key, value] pairs of a given object's own enumerable string properties.</li>
<li> (static) Object.getPrototypeOf() - returns the prototype (internal [[Prototype]] property) of the specified object. </li>
<li> (static) Object.seal() - prevents other code from deleting properties of an object. </li>
<li> (instance) Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty() - returns boolean true or false based on whether an object contains the specified property as a direct property of that object (not inherited through the prototype chain). </li>
<li> (instance) Object.prototype.__defineGetter__() - associates a function with a property that, when accessed, executes that function and returns its return value. </li>
<li> (instance) Object.prototype.toString() - returns a string representation of the object. </li>
</ul>

Overall the `Object` type is quite important to understand, as it explains a lot about prototype chains, inheritance and how JavaScript works in certain ways. Chances are one is already familiar with these functions in another object such as `Map`, since it is of type `Object` (along with almost everything else).
