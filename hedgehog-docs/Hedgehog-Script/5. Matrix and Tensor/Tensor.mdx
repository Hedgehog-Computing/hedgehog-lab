# Tensor

Tensor is a multi-dimensional array with a uniform type. In Hedgehog Lab, tensor is only used to store data. There are not any operations on tensor supported in Hedgehog Lab. 

### Create a tensor

You can create a tensor by using the `Tensor(n_dim_array)` constructor or `tensor` wrapper function. Both of them take an n-dimensional array as input. 


### Member variables and methods

`val: any[]`: The value of the tensor. It is a n-dimensional array.

`ndim: number`: The number of dimensions of the tensor.

`shape: number[]`: The shape of the tensor.

`dimensions(): number[]`: Return the shape of the tensor.

`toString(): string`: Return the string representation of the tensor, for example, a three-dimensional tensor will be serialized as a string in this format:

```js
[[[1, 2], 
[3, 4]], 
[[5, 6], 
[7, 8]]]
``` 

`toStringDenseMode`: Return the string representation of the tensor in dense mode, for example, a three-dimensional tensor will be serialized as a string in this format:

```js
[[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]]
```

`clone(): Tensor`: Return a copy of the tensor.

`copy( A: Tensor ): Tensor`: Copy the value of tensor `A` to the tensor.

`zerosAsShape( shape: number[] ): Tensor`: Return a tensor with the same shape as the input shape, and all elements are zeros.

`zeros( d1: number, d2: number, ...dn: number ): Tensor`: Return a tensor with the input shape, and all elements are zeros.
