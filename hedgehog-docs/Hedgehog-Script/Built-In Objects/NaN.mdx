# NaN

`NaN` means Not-A-Number. Let's see examples of `NaN`:

`NaN` is typically used in conjuction with conditional statements to handle `number` scenarios.

Here is a quick example of how to implement `NaN`:

:::info
`'1'` is a number, so `isNaN()` is false hence returns `'1'`. 

But `'stringhere'` is clearly not a number hence returns `NaN`
:::

Here are some operations that return `NaN`:

-  Failed number conversion (as in `Number(undefined)`, or implicitly `Math.abs(undefined)`)

-  Math operation where the result is not real (e.g. `Math.sqrt(-5)`) 

-  Indeterminate forms: (`0 * infinity`, `1 ** infinity1`, etc)

-  A method/expression whose operand gets coerced to `NaN`: (`7 ** NaN`, `7 * "word"`)

    - (`NaN` is contagious) 

-  Cases where an invalid value is represented as a number (`new Date("word".getTime())`) 


To test if something is `NaN`, one can use `Number.isNaN()`, otherwise there is `isNaN()`.

:::tip
Be careful for `NaN` values and make sure to check for them in `try...catch` methods or throw exceptions.
