# NaN

`NaN` means Not-A-Number. Let's see an example of `NaN`:

Here is a quick example of how to implement `NaN`:

:::info
'1' is a number, so `isNaN()` so it prints the value. But 'stringhere' is clearly not a number hence returns `NaN`
:::

Here are the operations that return NaN:

-  Failed number conversion (something like `Number(undefined)`, or implicitly `Math.abs(undefined)`)

-  Math operation where result is not real (e.g. `Math.sqrt(-5)`) 

-  Indeterminate forms: (`0*infinity`, `1**infinity1`, etc)

-  A method/expression whose operand gets coerced to `NaN`: (`7**NaN`, `7*"word"`) - (`NaN` is contagious) 

-  Cases where an invalid value is represented as a number (`new Date("word".getTime())`) 


To test if something is `NaN`, one can use `Number.isNaN()` for numbers, otherwise there is `isNaN()`.

:::tip
Be careful for `NaN` values and make sure to check for them in `try...catch` methods or throw exceptions.
:::

While going through the chapters it's good to internalize the differences between `NaN`, `undefined` and `null`.
