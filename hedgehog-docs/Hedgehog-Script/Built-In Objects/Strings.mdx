# Strings

`Strings` are objects used for textual data such as "Hello World!"

Their uses vary vastly, and they are an extremely common type, with many useful methods. 

But before we show said methods, let's learn how to create `Strings`:

Avoid using `String()` as a constructor for `Strings`

:::tip

Try to think about `Strings` as 1-D `Arrays`. For example the `String` "lailai" is kind of an `Array`:
 
`['l', 'a', 'i', 'l', 'a', 'i']`.

Let's go over some methods and properties frequently used:

- `strcmp()`: comparing strings

- `toUpperCase()` / `toLowerCase()`: changes strings case type

- `\{special character}` - escapes it. Hence views it as a literal

- `String.length` is the only property, the rest are methods!

- `String.at(index)` - returns the char at said index

- `String.includes(searchString)` - boolean based on if searchString is in the `String`

- `String.indexOf(searchValue)` - returns the index of the first instance of said value

Let's view an example of a practical scenario, using some `String` methods:

As one can imagine, there exists many, many more methods for `Strings`.
