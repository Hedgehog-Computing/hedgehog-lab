# Strings

`Strings` are `objects` used for textual data such as "Hello World!"

Their uses vary vastly, and they an extremely common type, with many useful methods. They are the type to represent, hold and manipulate data in a text format. 

Let's start out with an example of `String` usage:

This example demonstrates acting on `Strings` in Hedgehog Script.

:::warning
Avoid using `String()` as a constructor for `Strings`, as shown in the following example:

Try to think about `Strings` as 1-D `Arrays`: for example the `String` "lailai" is an `Array` containing textual elements:
 
`['l', 'a', 'i', 'l', 'a', 'i']`.

Naturally, we want to learn about `String` methods and properties, so let's go over some:

- `strcmp()`: comparing strings
- `toUpperCase()` / `toLowerCase()`: changes strings case type
- `\{special character}` - escapes i.e. treats like a literal special character
- `String.length` is the only property, the rest are methods!
- `String.at(index)` - returns the char at said index
- `String.includes(searchString)` - boolean based on if searchString is in the `String`
- `String.indexOf(searchValue)` - returns the index of the first instance of said value

Let's view an example of a practical scenario, using some `String` methods:

As one can imagine, there exists many, many more methods for `Strings`. See [Strings](/hedgehog-docs/Hedgehog-Script/Reference/StringExamples.mdx) for more.

However, for information regarding `String` object itself, visit: [Strings - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) for more information.
