# String

`string`s are objects used for textual data such as `'Hello World!'`

Let's start with how to create `string`s:

:::warning
Avoid using `String()` as a constructor for `string`s

Here are some more advanced methods for `string` operations:

Try to think about `Strings` as 1-D `Arrays`. For example the `String` "lailai" is kind of an `Array`:
 
`['l', 'a', 'i', 'l', 'a', 'i']`.

Let's go over some methods and properties frequently used:

- `strcmp()`: comparing strings

- `toUpperCase()` / `toLowerCase()`: changes strings case type

- `\{special character}` - escapes it. Hence views it as a literal

- `String.length` is the only property, the rest are methods!

- `String.at(index)` - returns the char at said index

- `String.includes(searchString)` - boolean based on if searchString is in the `String`

- `String.indexOf(searchValue)` - returns the index of the first instance of said value

Let's view an example of a practical scenario, using some `String` methods:

As one can imagine, there exists many, many more methods for `Strings`.
