# Basic Types

Hedgehog Script has several basic built-in types. These are opposed to constructed types, which are objects you make yourself.

Let's go over some and as well as discuss some other built-in Hedgehog Script objects.

### Primitive Values

These are immutable data represented directly at the lowest level of the language. Here are the list of all primitive types:


- `Boolean` - `true` or `false` value 
- `Null type` - can be thought of as non-existence of something. `null` is different than `undefined`.  
- `Undefined type` - a variable that has not been assigned a value is `undefined` for example  
- `Number` type - double precision 64 bit binary value. Is between +/- 2^-1074 (`Number.MIN_VALUE`) and +/- 2^1024 (`Number.MAX_VALUE`) 
- `BigInt` type - represents integers with arbitrary precision. `BigInts` can go beyond the safe integer limit for `Number` 
- `NaN` - stands for Not-a-number  
- `String` type - textual data. Hedgehog Script `Strings` are immutable.
- `Objects` (collections of properties) - an `object` is a value in memory which can be referenced by an identifier 


Here is an interactive Hedghog Lab window for you to try out types, whether primitive or built-in:

:::info
The `${}` in Hedgehog Script is a placeholder for an expression/variable/operation/etc.

That said placeholder is executed at runtime - its output passed as a string.

Another example of more primitive types is as follows:

There are many, many built-in objects available in Hedgehog Script.
