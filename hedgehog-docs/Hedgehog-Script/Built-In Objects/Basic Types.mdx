# Basic Types

Hedgehog Script has several basic built-in types. These are the complement to constructed types.

Let's discuss both, starting with primitives.

### Primitive Values

These are immutable data represented directly at the lowest level of the language. 

Here are the list of all primitive types:


- **`boolean`** - `true` or `false` value 

- **`null`** - can be thought of as non-existence of something. `null` is different than `undefined`

- **`undefined`** - a variable that has not been assigned a value is `undefined`

- **`number`** - double precision value between +/- 2^-1074 (`Number.MIN_VALUE`) and +/- 2^1024 (`Number.MAX_VALUE`) 

- **`bigint`** - represents integers with arbitrary precision. `BigInt` can go beyond the safe integer limit for `Number` 

- **`NaN`** - stands for Not-a-number  

- **`string`** - textual data. Hedgehog Script strings are immutable.

- **`object`** (collections of properties) - an `object` is a value in memory which can be referenced by an identifier 


The following is an example of some different types

:::info
The `${}` in Hedgehog Script is a placeholder for an expression/variable/operation/etc.

That said placeholder is executed at runtime - its output passed as a `String`.

:::tip

There are many, many built-in objects available in Hedgehog Script.
