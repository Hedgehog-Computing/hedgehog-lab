# Output

Output is crucial to any programming language. They define how a user can access information. 

There's two key ways to do so that we'll briefly go over:

- `console.log()`: logs to the web browser console

- `print()`: prints directly in the Hedgehog Lab environment
:::tip
In Chrome use 'F12' to open the console. Other browsers may vary slightly.
:::

Let's go over an example using both:

 <iframe
    src="https://hlab.app/s/docs/output_hbook"
    width="100%"
    height="400px"/>

:::tip

Use `print()` for users and `console.log()` for yourself
