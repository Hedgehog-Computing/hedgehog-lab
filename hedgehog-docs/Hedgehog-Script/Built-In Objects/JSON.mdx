# JSON

`JSON` is an object with methods for parsing JavaScript Object Notation (`JSON`) and converting said values to `JSON`. It only has two method properties.

The difference between JSON and JavaScript is important. `JSON` is a syntax for serializing objects, arrays, numbers, etc. It is **based** upon Hedgehog Script, (similar to JavaScript) syntax but is distinct from it.

:::note
JavaScript is **not** JSON
:::

There are certain things that are required for Objects/Arrays in JSON: must double quote property names. Trailing commas are forbidden. Leading zeros are forbidden, etc. Note that `NaN` and `Infinity` aren't supported.

Let's start by considering an example of one of the 2 methods: stringify

Note that one can also embed or nest JSON:

:::tip

Use `JSON.stringify()` to convert certain objects into strings!
:::

The mentioned methods are: `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify` (both `static`). The effective difference is parse transforms the string into `JSON` while stringify returns a `JSON` string. They both have a `replacer` and `reviver` option field. `reviver` allows for interpreting what `replacer` has replaced. Here's an example:


Now let's have a demo of `JSON.parse()` in conjunction with `JSON.stringify`:

And lastly, here's an example using the mentioned `reviver` and `replacer` options:

`JSON` can be an in-depth topic - this is an introduction and it can be very useful. Check out the MDN page for `JSON` here:
