# JSON

`JSON` is an object with methods for parsing and converting.


There are only two methods `JSON` uses.

`JSON` - JavaScript Object Notation

Hedgehog Script supports JavaScript

:::note
JavaScript is **not** `JSON`
:::

There are certain things that are required for `Objects` & `Arrays` in `JSON`: 

- One must double quote property names 

- Trailing commas and leading zeros are forbidden

- Note that `NaN` and `Infinity` aren't supported

Let's start with an example of one of the two methods: `stringify()`

Note that one can also embed or nest `JSON`:

:::tip

Use `JSON.stringify()` to convert certain objects into strings
:::

The mentioned methods are: `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify` (both `static`). 

The effective difference is parse transforms the string into `JSON` while stringify returns a `JSON` string. 

Both methods have `replacer` and `reviver` as option fields. `reviver` allows for interpreting what `replacer` has replaced. Here's an example:


Let's have a demo of `JSON.parse()` & `JSON.stringify()`:

Here's an example using the mentioned `reviver` and `replacer` options:

`JSON` can be an in-depth topic - this is only an introduction.
