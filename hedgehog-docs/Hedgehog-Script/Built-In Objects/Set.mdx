# `Set`

A `Set` is an object available as a data structure. 

- It has similarities and differences to `Map` and `Object`. 

    - `Map` resemble `Set` the most.

`Set` stores **unique** values - which can be virtually anything. 

:::info
Compared to mathematical sets, a `Set` in Hedgehog Script **must** have unique values with no duplication.

Here is an example of using `Set`:

One can iterate through a `Set` in insertion order just like a `Map`. 

The way to add new elements to a `Set` is using `add()`. 


Any implementation of a `Set` is required to have, on average, sub-linear access times.

<p> Just like maps, internally they can be like a hash table with <span>{ "\\(\\Omega(1)\\)" }</span> lookup time.</p>

<p>Then a search at <span>{ "\\(\\Omega(\\log(N))\\)" }</span> time, and anything else (as long as its better than) with less than <span>{ "\\(\\Omega(N)\\)" }</span> time. </p>
</MathJax>

### Set Methods

Here are some vital methods within `Set`:

- `Set.has(value)`checks if a value is in that `Set` object

- One can create a `Set` using the constructor `Set()`

- An example instance property is: `Set.size` - (returns number of elements in `Set`)

- `Set.add()` - Inserts a new element with a specified value in to a `Set` object, **if** there isn't one with the same value already

- `Set.clear()` - Remove all elements from the `Set` object

- `Set.values()`, `Set.keys()` and `Set.entries()` - returns an iterator that contains: values, keys and entries, respectively

- `Set.forEach()` -  Iterates through the values. Similar to `Array.forEach()` or `Map.forEach()`


Some examples of using the `Set` object:

:::tip
That was a long example! One thing to note is the last function: 
- it uses the mentioned method `Set.forEach()`, `JSON`, conditional ternary operator `?` and an arrow function!

If one is confused this is how it works: 
- In **insertion order**, `set1` is iterated over and runs the function which takes in `value` as the argument

- Then it checks if `a` is an `object`: if so, parse it. Otherwise, keep it the same. 

- Then `print` the value - stringified, so `objects` can be shown!

:::info
There are quite a lot of elementary functions one can write and use. 

More information can be found here: [Sets - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set).
:::

Lastly, a practical function of `Set` is to decompose `String`:

- Note that entries are stored as [value, value]

:::tip
A really good use of `Sets` is their ability to remove duplicate elements in `Arrays`:

Just transform the `Array` to a `Set` and then the `Set` back into an `Array`.
