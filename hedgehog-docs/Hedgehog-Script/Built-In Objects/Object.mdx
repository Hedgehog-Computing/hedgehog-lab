# Object

`Object` is a type just like `String` is a type. However, `Objects` are effectively data structures since they store, manage and modify data - specifically key-value pairs.

:::info
`Objects` are quite important to learn and understand as they are the top level, the pinnacle type. Almost everything is derived from the object `Object` in Hedgehog Script.
:::

Let's discuss the `constructor` for `Object` - which creates `Objects`: 

- If the input is `null` or `undefined` you will get an empty `Object`. If the argument is an `object` itself it will return itself.

- Otherwise, the `constructor` will return an `object` of a type that corresponds to the given argument.

Let's view an example of creating `Objects`:

:::info
There is no direct method to delete `Object` properties like `Map` (which has `Map.delete() ` ) for example. Rather, one must use the delete operator. 
:::

There are quite a few methods, static or instance, for `Object`. Let's point out some of them:

- `Object()` - the `constructor`, takes the input and makes it an object. 

- (`static`) `Object.entries()` - returns an array with all [key, value] pairs of a given object. 

- (`static`) `Object.seal()` - prevents other code from deleting properties of an object. 

- (`instance`) `Object.hasOwnProperty()` - returns `true` or `false` based on whether the object has the direct property.

- (`instance`) `Object.toString()` - returns a `String` representation of the object. 


`Objects` can be quite a complex topic. They are fundamental and have a long list of methods and details.
