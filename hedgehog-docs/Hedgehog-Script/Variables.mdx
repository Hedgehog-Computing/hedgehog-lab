#  Variables

You can define variable and constant in this way:

With Typescript you can use the keyword `let` for a variable, for example, `let x = 10;`
You can also define a variable without a keyword, for example, `x = 10;`
Lastly, for constants, you can use keyword `const`, for example, `const x = 10`.

There is also the `var` declaration if you want to declare a variable globally, or locally to a function. `let` allows you to limit the variables to the scope of a block statement. Not using any declaration gives it complete global access.
