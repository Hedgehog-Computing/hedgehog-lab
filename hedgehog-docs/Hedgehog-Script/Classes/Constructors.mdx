# Constructors

The `constructor` method is a special, unique method of a `class` to initialize an instance of that class.

A simple example is the following:

<iframe
    src="https://hlab.app/s/docs/constructor_hbook"
    width="100%"
    height="400px"/>

:::note
`constructor()` can have an arbitrary amount of parameters, including none.
:::

A `constructor` is powerful in the sense that it can manage all the initialization of an object, executing before anything else.

:::tip
You don't **need** to write a `constructor`! 

- A virtual, empty one will be inserted by default. 

- Similarly if you forget to call `super()` in a subclass, Hedgehog Script will call it for you.
