# Constructors

The `constructor` method is a special, unique method of a `class` for creating and initializing an object instance of that class.

A very simple example is the following:

<iframe
    src="https://hlab.app/s/docs/constructor_hbook"
    width="100%"
    height="500px"
></iframe>

:::note
`constructor()` can have an arbitrary amount of parameters, including none.
:::

A `constructor` can be powerful due to being able to give custom initialization, hence customized templates of objects (classes). Initialization implies it runs before anything else in the class.

:::tip
You don't need to write a `constructor`! A virtual, empty one will be inserted by default. And if you forget to call `super()` in a subclass, Hedgehog Script will call it for you. 
:::

We won't worry about subclass and superclass examples in this book, as the features aren't fully supported in Hedgehog Script, it is good to know they exist though.

Overall, if one intends to use classes in JavaScript, `constructors` are vital to understand and implement as they are required and also greatly increase power through being able to perform custom initialization.
