# Classes

Classes are a **template** for creating objects. 

Their syntax is like `functions`: define class expressions and give a class declaration.

The purpose of classes is to create an abstraction of certain `Objects`. 

Then one can use the template to repeatedly create new objects of that type. 

An example: cars are vehicles - which are machines - a Honda is a car type, specifically a 2001 Honda Civic. 

- Can you define the subclasses and superclasses?

:::info
`Classes` are just `Objects` under the hood.
:::

Let's view an example of declaring a `class` with a `constructor`:


<iframe
    src="https://hlab.app/s/docs/classex1_hbook"
    width="100%"
    height="600px" />

A `Class` can have both subclasses and superclasses. Hence, one can effectively have inheritance. 

:::caution
A ReferenceError will be thrown if a class is constructed or initialized before it's declared. (unlike functions)
:::

The way we defined the class above is via class expressions. 

There is another way, direct declaration:

<iframe
    src="https://hlab.app/s/docs/classex2_hbook"
    width="100%"
    height="500px" />

:::tip
As shown above one can do a few important things in the class body: 

- define methods/properties and define the constructor

:::info

An important concept is binding `this`. Check out [this](../Expressions%20%26%20Operators/this.mdx) to learn about `this`.
:::


Regarding subclasses, creating them as a derived class is as simple as adding `extends`:
- `class [subClassName] extends [className] {constructor(...) { super(...) } }`
<p>&nbsp;</p>

:::info

One can override class body methods: Consider 'Animal' has a subclass 'Hippo', which has a different version of `eat()`.
 
 - Instances of 'Hippo' will use their `eat()` instead of `Animal.eat()`.
