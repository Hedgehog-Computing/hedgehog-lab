Before reading this please note that classes are in an experimental stage in Hedgehog Script and not ready right now.

# Classes

Classes are a **template** for creating objects. They have similar syntax as `functions`: define class expressions and give a class declaration.

The purpose of classes is to create an abstraction of certain `Objects`. Then use the template to repeatedly create new `objects` of that type. An example could be - cars are vehicles - which are machines, and a Honda is a car type, specifically a 2001 Honda Civic. Can you define the subclasses and superclasses?

:::info
`Classes` are just `Objects` under the hood.
:::

Let's view an example of declaring a `class` with a `constructor` and using said `class` to do something:

    width="100%"
    height="600px" />

A `class` can have both `subclasses` and `superclasses`. Hence, you can effectively have inheritance among other things.

:::caution
A ReferenceError will be thrown if a class is constructed or initialized before it's declared. (unlike functions)
:::

The way we defined the class above is via class expressions. There is another way, direct declaration:

:::tip
As shown above you can do a few important things in the class body: define members (i.e. methods, properties) and define the constructor (only 1 can exist per class).
:::

An important concept is binding `this`. If a static method is called without a value for `this` (example - by assigning the method to a variable and then calling it), `this` will then be `undefined` in the method. For example having a function like this: `static func1() { return this; }`, when calling `func1()`, `this` will be `undefined`. Rewrite it like the following example to bind `this` correctly.

    src="https://hlab.app/s/docs/classesex_hbook"
    width="100%"
    height="400px"/>

For subclasses, creating them as a derived class is as simple as adding `extends`. Here is the syntax:
- `class [subClassName] extends [className] {constructor(...) { super(...) } }`

:::info

One can override class body methods: If the class 'Animal' has subClass 'Hippo', and have a different version of `eat()` then instances of 'Hippo' will use their `eat()`instead of `Animal.eat()`.

`Classes` are powerful if one needs a hierachical system of functions, each with their own properties and inherited properties. They are relatively simple to make and use, and have many useful methods.
