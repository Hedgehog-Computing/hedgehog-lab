#  Control Flow


Block statements are used to group several statements into a single block. The block is delimited by a pair of curly brackets `{}`. Block statements are commonly used with control flow statements such as if, for or while.

## if-else statement
Use the `if` statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is `true`. Use the optional `else` clause to execute a statement if the condition is `false`. Lastly, you can have a `if-else if` statement which is a block statement that when the `if` condition fails, it checks if the next `if` conditions is true or not, and then the next one... and so on..

Here is an example:

## For statement
A `for` loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to `false`. The Hedgehog Script `for` loop is the same as JavaScript, which is similar to the Java and C `for` loop. A `for` statement looks as follows:

```
for ([initialExpression]; [condition]; [incrementExpression]) { 
  statement }
```
Here is an example:

## while and do-while statement
The `while` statement creates a loop that executes a specified statement as long as the test condition evaluates to `true`. The condition is evaluated *before* executing the statement.

Here is the syntax for `while` statement:
```
while (condition) {
  statement }
```

The `do...while` statement creates a loop that executes a specified statement until the test condition evaluates to `false`. The condition is evaluated *after* executing the statement, resulting in the specified statement executing _at least once_.

Here is the syntax for `do...while` statement:
```
do {
   statement }
while (condition);
```
Here are examples for `while` and `do...while` statements in Hedgehog Lab:

These are the basic ways to control the logical flow of your script/program in Hedgehog Lab.
