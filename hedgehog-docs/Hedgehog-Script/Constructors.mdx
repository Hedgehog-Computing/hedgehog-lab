# Constructors

The `constructor` method is a special, unique method of a `class` for creating and initializing an object instance of that class.

A very simple example is the following:

```js
class Shape {
    constructor() {
        this.name = 'Shape';
        this.initShape = 'Circle';
        this.area = 1;
    }
}

const shape1 = new Shape();
print(shape1.name); //outputs "Shape"
print(shape1.initShape); //outputs "Circle";
print(shape1.area); //outputs 1
```
`Constructors` can also have multiple arguments, or none, like in the above case.

The importance of a `constructor` is that it provides the ability to have custom initialization that's done before any other methods are called on the instantiated object. Basically, when a new class instance is made (`const class1 = new ClassName(...optionalArgsForConstructor);`), the constructor is immediately run before any other method. 

If a `constructor` is not written a default, empty one will be inserted virtually: `constructor() {}`. Also, if your class is a subclass/derived class the default constructor calls the parent constructor while passing along any argument provided through the use of `super()`. Since `constructors` follow normal method syntax, various things can be used especially parameter default values, rest parameters and more. Lastly, the `constructor` must be a literal name, it cannot be a computed one.

Here is an example displaying various aspects of the `constructor` in action:

```js
class Polygon {
    constructor() {
        this.name = "Polygon";
    }
}

class Square extends Polygon {
    constructor() {
        super();
    }
}
class Rectangle {}

Object.setPrototypeOf(Square.prototype, Rectangle.prototype);

print(Object.getPrototypeOf(Square.prototype) === Polygon.prototype); //false
print(Object.getPrototypeOf(Square.prototype) === Rectangle.prototype); //true

const newInstance = new Square();
print(newInstance.name); //outputs "Polygon"
```

Overall, if one intends to use classes in JavaScript, `constructors` are vital to understand and implement as they are required and also greatly increase power through being able to perform custom initialization.
