# Loop Statements

When needing to do a task multiple times, it's common to use a **loop statement**.

These are statements that create a cyclic execution of code until a *condition is met*.

Some examples are `for`, `do {} while` and `while{}`. 

- Within these, `break;` and `continue;` can be used.

---

## `for` Statement

A `for` loop repeats until the **specified condition** evaluates to `false`. 

The Hedgehog Script loop statement using `for` has this syntax:

```js
for ([initialExpression]; [condition]; [incrementExpression]) {

  statementList 
}
```

The loop will keep going until the expression makes the condition **false**.

:::info

It is common to use `let i = 0;` as the `initialExpression`, and `i++;` as the `incrementExpression`

## `while` & `do-while` Statements

The statements `while` and `do-while` are both loops that are almost the same.

The minor difference is when the *condition* is checked:

- In a `while` loop the condition is checked at the beginning

- Versus a `do-while` loop it is checked at the end

### `while`

The `while` loop executes a statement list as long as the test condition evaluates to **`true`**.

The condition is evaluated **before** executing the statements.

Here is the syntax for `while` loop statements:

```js
while (condition) {

  statementList

}
```
### `do-while`
Identically, the `do-while` loop runs as long as the test condition evaluates to **`true`**.

However, the condition is evaluated **after** executing the statement list.

Here is the syntax for `do-while` statement:

```js
do {
   statementList
}
while (condition);
```

Here are examples for `while` and `do-while` loops in Hedgehog Script:

## `break;` & `continue;`

Within all three of these loops, the statements `break;` and `continue [label];` can be used.

In a loop context, `break;` causes the execution to **immediately halt** and **exit** the loop.

- It can be useful for throwing errors among other things

On the otherhand, `continue;` statements in a loop context can do two things:

- Normally when called by itself "`continue;`" will instead immediately **skip** the current loop iteration. 

- However, `continue;` can also be used with the optional `label` (i.e. `continue label1;`)
    
    - Whereever that `label` is located is where control flow will jump to. 

Here is an example of both versions of `continue [label];` being used:

And here is an example of `break;`
