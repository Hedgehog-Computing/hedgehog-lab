# Conditional Statements

**Control flow** is about the order of execution.

Conditional statements are a part of control flow, since their conditions can change the order of execution.

Let's discuss the basics of **conditional statements**.

---

### `if`, `if-else` and `if-else if`

To control the flow of execution, one may wish to have different things happen based on a condition.

`if` is used for this purpose. 

The `if` statement is composed of a **condition** and statements to run if the condition is true:

With `if`, one can add an `else` statement afterwards to execute something if the condition fails:

The syntax is:

```js
if (condition) {
    //statements
}
else {
    //otherwise, statements
}
```

And lastly, one can combine and `else-if` into the mix for multiple conditional cases.

The syntax using `else-if` is:

```js
if (condition) {
    //if statements
}
else if (condition2) {
    //else-if statements
}
else if (condition3) {
    //else-if 2 statements
}
...
[else {
    //else statements...
}];
```

:::info

When using `[]` around something in syntax, it means that statement/declaration is **optional**

Here is an example covering a mix of what we've discussed:

### `switch` Statements 

The statement `switch` is effectively another version of `if else-if ... [else]` chains.

The syntax of a `switch` case is as follows:

```js
switch(expression) {
    case value1:
        //statements if expression matches value1
        break; 
    case value2:
        //statements if expression matches value2
        break;
    ...
    case valueN:
        //statements if expression matches valueN
        break;
    [default: 
        //statements executed when none of the values match the expression
        break; ]
}
```

There is an optional statement in this syntax: namely, `default: `

First we need to quickly cover `break` statements to understand a switch case:

- A `break` statement effectively "breaks out" of control flow.

- In the context of `switch` cases, calling `break;` forces control flow to leave the switch case.

What is `default: ` and why is it optional?

- Regarding `default: `, if it is provided, something **will** happen whether or not a case succeeds.

    - However, if it isn't provided, then simply **nothing** will happen if all cases fail.

It all depends on how the user wants the program to function.

Here is an example of a basic `switch` case:

Here's an example with no default case being used:
