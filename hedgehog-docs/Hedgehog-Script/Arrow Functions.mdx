# Arrow Function Expressions

Arrow functions are a different way to write and create functions versus the standard function expression we're all used to. It is more compact, but is more limited.

Here are some key differences:

<ul>
<li> Arrow functions should not be used as `methods` since they do not have their own bindings to `this`, `arguments` or `super`.</li>
<li> Arrow functions can't use the keyword `new.target`. </li>
<li> Arrow functions can't use `call`, `apply` and `bind` methods. </li>
<li> Arrow functions can't be used as `constructors`. </li>
<li> Arrow functions can't use `yield` in it's body. </li>
</ul>

Let's first view the normal, standard function expression (using the `function` keyword):

```js
function myFunction(parameter0, parameter1, parameter2) {
    return parameter0+parameter1+parameter2;
}
```

Now that we've recalled that let's see how to express an arrow function:

```js
//for named functions, the ones most widely used:
const myFunction = (parameter0, parameter1, parameter2) => parameter0+parameter1+parameter2;

//for anonymous functions an example is:
(a, b) => a*b;

// the above is the same as:

function (a,b) {
    return a*b;
}
```

Note that when there are multiple arguments or no arguments, you need parantheses around the arguments (like in the example above before the arrow).

Another note is if there's additional lines of statements or processing within the function, then braces need to exist, wrapping the statements and the return statement:

```js
(a, b) => {
    let var1 = 50;
    return a+b+var1;
};
```
Let's break down what's happening. The structure of a arrow functions are like this:

```js
//for one argument, you dont require parentheses around the parameters
param => expression

//for multiple, you do need parantheses:

(param1, param2) => expression

//extra statements for processing require braces:

param => {
    let var1 = 30;
    return var1 + param;
};
```

Basically the steps are:

1) Remove the word `function` and place arrows between the arguments first body bracket
2) Remove the body brackets (unless there's additional lines of processing) and remove the word return since it is implied (unless again, it has extra lines for processing).
3) Remove the argument parantheses (unless theres multiple or none such as in an anonymous function).

Overall remember the cases where arrow functions are not applicable but still become familiar with how they're used because many people use arrow functions in their code, and to understand their code you must first understand arrow function expressions.
