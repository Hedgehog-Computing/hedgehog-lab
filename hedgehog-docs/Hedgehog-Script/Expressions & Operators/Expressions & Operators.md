# Expressions & Operators

There are infinitely many operators and expressions one can create and use.

Hedgehog Script has some built-in ones, and we'll briefly cover some here.


- An **expression** is defined as:
  - A "valid set of literals, variables, opereators and expressions that evaluate to a single value that is an expression".

- **Operators** are defined as:
  -  "Special symbols used to perform operations on operands (values and variables)".

Let's name a few very common, fundamental ones:

- `+, -, /, *` (addition, subtraction/difference, division, multiplication)

- `=, +=, -=, *= `(assignment, addition/subtraction/multiplication assignment) 

- `">", "<", ">=", "<="` (greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, less than or equal to)

- `&&, ||, !` (logical AND, logical OR, logical NOT/negation)

- `++, --, **, ===` (increment, decrement, exponetiation, identity)

- `?` (conditional ternary operator)

- `new` operator, `...` spread syntax, `null`, `this`

Here is an example of some:
