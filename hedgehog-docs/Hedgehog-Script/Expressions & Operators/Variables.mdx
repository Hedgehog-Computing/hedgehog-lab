#  Variables
You can define variable and constant in this way:

- With Hedgehog Script you can use the keyword `let` for a variable, for example, `let x = 10;`

- You can also define a variable without a keyword, for example, `x = 10;`

- Lastly, for constants, you can use keyword `const`, for example, `const x = 10`

    - `const` means constant as the variable can't change

:::warning

Do not define variables with no keyword, this is the same as saying `var variableName = value`

Regarding `var`, it shouldn't be used! 

:::

Let's view a simple example of variable declaration:

    width="100%"

One can also declare multiple variables quickly, in one line:

<iframe src="https://hlab.app/s/docs/varex2_hbook"
    width="100%"
    height="300px"/>

:::caution

Declare variables at the top of the scope they're used.

And certainly declare them before intializing them (hoisting not supported)
