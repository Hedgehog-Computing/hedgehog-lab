# Regular Expressions (Regex)

`RegExp` is a powerful object that matches text to a pattern.

There are two ways to create said object:

- 1) Literal notation - pattern and/or options enclosed by `/ /`

- 2) Constructor - take in a string or literal and option flags as parameters 


The following 3 expressions create the same exact regular expression object:

The 'i' is one of many flags, specifically for making the search case-insensitive.

Let's breakdown the regular expression `/ab+c/`: 

- `+` after b means to match at least one 'b'

- 'a' and 'c' are simply the beginning and end of the pattern

  - 'abc' matches, as well as 'abbbc'. 'ababc' does not

A great example is `/be+/`:  'bee', 'bent', 'bear' are all matches.

### Character classes and Anchors

A **character class** matches any one set of characters. 

Here are some examples:

- `[ae]` matches the "a" in "based", and "e" in "lane"

- `[^ae]` matches anything **not** in the character class - "r", "g", "n" are matched in "green"

- `[A-P]` matches any character in the range A through P

- `\w` matches any word character - "V", "e", "2", "0", **not "."** in "Ve2.0"

**Anchors** cause a match to suceed or fail based on the **current position in the string**.

They don't cause advancement through the string or consume characters.

Here's a few examples:

- `$` match must occur at the end 

- `\A` match must occur at the start of the string

- `\b` match must occur on a boundary between a word character and a non-word character
