# Null

`null` is relatively simple; it is a primitive value i.e. a basic type. It's responsibility is to represent the intentional absence of any object value. So one can think of `null` as not-existing. Let's dive in a little deeper.

`null`, unlike `undefined` is not an identifier for a property of the global object. Instead, `null` express a lack of identification, indicating that a **variable points to no object**. 

Note that you can even initilialize or set variables to `null`:
```js
const var1 = null;
print(var1) //null error
```

There are some key differences between `null` and `undefined` - when checking for them, beware of the difference between equality (==) and identity (===), as identity performs type-conversion:

Be careful for `null` values as they can throw errors, make sure to try-catch them or throw exceptions. There are uses when you do want something to be null however. Overall, keep in mind the differences between `null` and `undefined` or `NaN`
