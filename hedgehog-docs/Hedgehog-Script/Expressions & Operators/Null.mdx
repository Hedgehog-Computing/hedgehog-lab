# Null

`null` is simple - it is a primitive type meaning 'non-existent'.

It's responsibility is to represent the intentional absence of any object value. 

`null`, unlike `undefined`, is not an identifier for a property of the global object. Instead, `null` expresses a lack of identification.

The other way to think about `null` is that a `null` variable points to no object.  

Let's view an example, specifically initialization:

    width="100%"
    height="300px"/>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

:::caution

In the following example we use `===` to learn about `null`. 

While `==` differs from `===` (equality vs identity), **only identity (`===`) is allowed.**

    width="100%"
    height="500px"/>

:::tip
Overall, be aware of `null` and learn where they can show up. Use `try...catch` blocks to handle them. 

Lastly, it's good to understand the differences between `null`, `undefined`, and `NaN`.
