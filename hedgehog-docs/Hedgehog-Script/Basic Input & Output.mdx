# Basic Input & Output

Input and Output (I/O) are crucial to any programming language. They define how a user can access or put in information, creating cases where there is a connection between a user and the program. Let's first discuss output as we've used output many times throughout this book:

There is the browser console using `console.log()` along with `print()` in Hedgehog Script. The first logs things to the web browser console, while the latter prints it out in the Hedgehog Lab environment. 

There are other, important methods of output though. One is `innerHTML`. To access an HTML element, JavaScript can use `document.getElementById(id)`. The `id` attribute defines the HTML element. The `innerHTML` property defines the HTML content:

```js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>Web page</h1>
<p>Paragraph</p>

<p id="example"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("example").innerHTML = 1 + 2;
</script>

</body>
</html>
```
This will display '3' After the header and paragraph, as it is inner HTML. This is a common way of how to display data in HTML.

Another way of outputting data is using `document.write()`. Consider the above example, but replace the `<script>...</script>` content with `document.write(1+2);`. There is a big downside though - using `document.write()` after an HTML doc is loaded will delete all existing HTML.

Lastly, we can use `window.alert()`. This is useful for outputting data to an alert box. It can be used like this:

```js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>Web page</h1>
<p>Paragraph</p>

<p id="example"></p>

<script>
window.alert(1+2);
</script>

</body>
</html>
```
This will render an HTML document with a header and paragraph, and a window pop up alerting you of data, namely, '3'. Note that `window` can be dropped and you can simply use `alert()`.

Now let's move on to inputting data:

Again, input is needed to create an interactive program for a user. There is several ways of doing so, the main one discussed being `prompt()`. This is a function that asks user for input. The parameter of `prompt()` will be what text is displayed to the user, such as 'Enter birth date here: '. Once the user inputs data and presses 'ok', `prompt()` returns the input value. Typically, one will store the return value in a variable so it can be used/modified. Note that one can also use `window.prompt()`.

There is also input for JavaScript based HTML: Button objects, Form objects, Option and Select objects, etc. We won't cover these but it's good to be aware of them. 

Overall, it's vital to learn how to display data or output it and how to store and take in data, i.e. input. It's needed for an interactive environment which is used in many, many cases.
