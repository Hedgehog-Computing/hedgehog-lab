# `Mat`

The `Mat` object is very useful for matrix-like operations in Hedgehog Script. 

- It can be 1 dimensional, 2D, 3D, etc. It can also represent tensors!

To declare one, do the same as you would for an `object` (by using the `new` keyword).

Here's an example:

    height="300px"/>


Don't forget to use `( )` to construct it!

:::info

When constructing a `Mat`, always have at least 2 layers of brackets. Something like `new Mat([1,2,3,4])` is forbidden.

### We support many functions for matrices:

- Basic summation, multiplication, elementwise-operations, decompositions, processing data and much more.

  - It's all there, built-in, easy to use.

- However, those functions are located in the "Math" book (top navigation bar). In this section we simply give the basics.

Here are the fundamental properties of `Mat` objects:

`rows`, `cols`, `val`. Sub-properties include: `val.length`, `val[0].length`. 

There are vital for operating around a matrix. An example of some properties at play:

Use the property `val` to transform a `Mat` into a raw `Array`:

`myMat_raw = myMat.val;`

Typical `Array` functions can now be performed on `myMat_raw`.

Close to all built in Math functions for Hedgehog Lab work for `Array`s, `Tensor`s and `Mat`s.

However, if you only have a normal `Array` you are limited to Hedgehog Script's `Array` libraries. 

Here is an example of using `Mat` in a function:

`Mat` is a powerful tool for representing and operating on matrices. 

Check out the "Math" book to become more familiar about usages of `Mat` and its functions!
