# Markdown

In Hedgehog Lab you can encapsulate output in markdown. 

This is done by calling the markdown function: 

```js
markdown(' Your markdown here ')
```

For multiple lines, use **template strings** instead:

```js
markdown(` 
# Your markdown title1

## Your markdown title2 

Your markdown context
`)
```

Here is an example:

<iframe src="https://hlab.app/s/docs/markdown_hbook"
    width="100%"
    height="800px"/>

:::tip

To learn **markdown** one can use Google for a variety of many resources.
