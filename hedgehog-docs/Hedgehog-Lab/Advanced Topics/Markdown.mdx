In Hedgehog Lab you can encapsulate output in markdown. All you have to do is call the markdown function: 

```
markdown(' Your markdown here ')
```

or for multiple lines, using template strings instead:

```
markdown(` 
# Your markdown title1

## Your markdown title2 

Your markdown context
`)
```

An example is as follows:

<iframe src="https://hlab.app/s/docs/markdown_hbook"
    width="100%"
    height="800px">
  </iframe>

If you're interested in using this, there are a variety of well documented resources on the internet regarding markdown syntax.
