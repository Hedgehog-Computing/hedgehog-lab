# TeX

Hedgehog Lab can have output displayed as **TeX**

To write something in **TeX**, call `tex()` and input the **TeX** as a parameter:

``` tex("\\text{Welcome to Hedgehog Lab.}") ```

- `\\text` is used to create a string

- Your actual text will be in the `{}` space

- Everything is encapsulated by double quotations (`"  "`)

This is how to write a **formula** in TeX:

- `formulaTex("Y = mx + b")`

To convert a `variable` to TeX just call the `toTex()` method:

- `A.toTex()`
