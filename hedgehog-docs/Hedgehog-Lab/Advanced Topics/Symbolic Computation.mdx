# Symbolic Computation

**Symbols** can be used along with **TeX** for writing formulas and calculating them.

The first step is to declare a `variable` as a `Symbol`:

```js
let x = sym('x')
```

Then write an expression using that symbol:

```js
let fx = (x^3) + sin(x)
```

You can output the formula:
```js
formulaTex `f(x)= ${fx}`
```

Here is an example of performing calculations on the formula:

- Finding a derivative:
```js
formulaTex`f'(x) = ${diff(fx, x)}` 
```

- Calculating an integral:
```js
formulaTex`\int{f(x)dx} = ${integrate(fx, x)}`
```

//take 1 or 2 examples (integral and derivatve exponents)
Here's an example with many types of calculations:
