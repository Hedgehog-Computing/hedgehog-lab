## Using symbols and TeX for writing & calculating formulas

We have a feature for symbols that can be used along with TeX and some of our own functions for writing formulas and even calculating them.

To start, you would declare a variable as a symbol:

```js
let x = sym('x')
```

Then you can write an expression using that symbol:

```js
let fx = (x^3) + sin(x)
```

Then you can output the formula as such:
```js
formulaTex `f(x)= ${fx}`
```

To perform calculations on the formula, you can use diff() and integrate():

```js
formulaTex`f'(x) = ${diff(fx, x)}`
```
or, 
```js
formulaTex`\int{f(x)dx} = ${integrate(fx, x)}`
```

Here's an example below of many different functions being used, specifically, integrals, derivatives, trigonometric functions, exponential functions, and partial derivatives/integrals:

Please view the TeX section if you're unfamiliar with using TeX, as it's used in symbolic computation.
