# Table

1. Tables can be used to neatly display data in a row-column manner

2. Hedgehog Script has some built-in functions for making and showing Tables:

    - `new Table()` is the constructor, typically you'd enter raw cvs
    - `showTable()` is the analogue to `print()`, it will display the table


**To build a table follow these steps:**

- Create a csv string yourself or import one

- Feed the csv string into the table constructor

- Use `showTable()` to output it

Here is an example:

A way to check your csv string is by calling `csv2mat()`

It will print what the table will look like in a Matrix.
