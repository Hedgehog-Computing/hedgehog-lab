## Viewing figures

We are using plotlyjs currently for data visualization. We have plans to implement e-charts in the future, however.

To view figures, there's a variety of implemented functions that you can use to generate different graphs. We will list ours in the example below, the rest can be used through plotlyjs.

To use them, you need to have sets of points that you use as parameters. Also the examples used are the functions:
<ul>
    <li>plot2D(...) - Note: this is a scatter plot</li>
    <li>plot2DLine(...)</li>
    <li>plot3D(...) - Note: this is a scatter plot</li>
    <li>plot3DMesh(...)</li>s
</ul>
