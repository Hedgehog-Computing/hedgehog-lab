# GPU Acceleration

1. Hedgehog Lab supports **GPU acceleration** for computations done inside the browser.

2. GPU Acceleration utilizes the power of your graphics card(s) to increase performance.

3. It can take significantly less time for some matrix calculations among other things.

4. To use it, set a `variable`'s `mode` property to 'gpu'.

Here is an example:
