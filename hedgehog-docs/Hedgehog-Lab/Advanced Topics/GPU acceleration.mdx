## What it is and how to use it

GPU acceleration is a feature in Hedgehog Lab that utilizes the power of your graphics card to do computations, **sometimes** taking significantly less time for matrix calculations and such.

To use it, you simply set a variable's `mode` property to `'gpu'`.

Here is an example below. Try running it yourself with various dimensions or different calculations to see if it makes an impact. Note that it differs from computer to computer.
