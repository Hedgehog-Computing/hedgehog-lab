# Registering

** A quick guide on how to register for Hedgehog Lab for free and begin writing snippets... **

To register for Hedgehog Lab it's really easy. All you do is click the top right 'Account' or the left-hand 'Login' button and it'll prompt your for your username and password.

Since we're new, we will instead click 'Sign up' which prompts for the username you'd like to use, an email account, and a password. 

Below is a picture displaying the buttons and their locations.

Once you've put in your information and clicked 'Sign Up', you're done!

Here is another picture, and again registering can be accessed through the top right 'Account' button and the left sidebar 'Login' button.
