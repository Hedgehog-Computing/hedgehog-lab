# The Environment

We have seen the landing or home page of Hedgehog Lab. Now let's dive into the environment - the area where you create snippets.

Here is an embedded example you can follow along with:

<iframe src="https://hlab.app/s/docs/hello_hbook"
    width="100%"
    height="300px">
</iframe>

Let's discuss the various features in the environment:
<ul>
<li> Top left sidebar: click it to see the same thing as on the home page - quick and easy access to everything you need </li>
<li> Blue button in the center on top: Switches between live mode and non-live mode. In live mode, the results will be executed automatically, if it's turned off, one will have to run the script to make it execute.</li>
<li> Fullscreen: make the environment fill the whole screen </li>
<li> Discord: our official discord </li>
<li> Github: our official Github page </li>
<li> Run: executes, or runs, the program </li>
<li> Left-hand side of the screen: the written code to execute </li>
<li> Right-hand side of the screen: the results of the code being executed </li>
</ul>
