# Browser Requirements

We support the latest versions of **Chrome**, **Safari**, **Microsft Edge**, **Brave** and any browsers with a **Chromium**-based core. Firefox is not supported at this time. But before you start, make sure you have the latest version of your browser.

### GPU Acceleration

Make sure WebGL and/or WebGL2 is enabled in your browser. You can check this by going to [https://webglreport.com/](https://webglreport.com/). If WebGL is not enabled, you will see a red warning. If WebGL is enabled, you will see a green checkmark.

Also you can check the performance of following benchmark script. If the benchmark of GPU is faster than CPU, WebGL is enabled.
