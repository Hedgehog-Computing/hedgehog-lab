# Hedgehog Lab
**A Guide to using Hedghog Lab ... **



## Getting Started

The first thing you want to do is open up "hlab.app" in chrome, firefox, etc. Preferably chrome as GPU acceleration runs on it by default.

You'll notice a variety of buttons and options available to you, let's talk about them.

## Hedgehog Lab Tutorial

We will use an array tutorial example for the visual reference: 

<iframe src="https://hlab.app/s/docs/array2_hbook" width = "100%" height = "500px" />

Click the 3 horizontal bars in the top left. This gives you the snippet access. You can create a new snippet (very typical when starting a new script), you can explore using search terms and by how "hot" it is. There is the Timeline, a feature to see other user's snippets, specifically users who you follow. Similar to a timeline on Facebook or Twitter if you consider that. Then you have the current snippets you've been working on. And lastly, you have your profile. In your profile, you can see your snippets, how hot they are, the number of likes or shares they have, whether they're public or not and you can customize certain aspects. Click the 3 horizontal bars to close the snippet access and let's continue.

Next, we have a toggle button for '{snippet_name}' and LiveMode. In LiveMode, the code is executed continuously as you write. In the other case, you have to click 'Run' on the ** top-right ** to execute your code each time. 

Then there is a few buttons for options and links. The first is 'Fullscreen'. This puts the lab in fullscreen mode. Specifically, it makes the **output** fullscreen and hides the code. 

Then there's the 'Book' link which is a hyperlink to the book you're reading now!

There's the 'Discord' link which links to the official Hedgehog Lab Discord channel.

Lastly, there's the 'GitHub' link which sends you to the open source project where you can become a member and contribute if you want to or look at our code. 

There is also the 'Run' button we mentioned, which executes the code in the non-LiveMode. 

## Wrapping Up

Now that you know every feature and button on the hedgehog lab screen, you can begin to write on the left hand side in Hedgehog Script to write your own snippets!
