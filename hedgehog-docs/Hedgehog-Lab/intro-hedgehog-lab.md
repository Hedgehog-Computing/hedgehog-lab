# Hedgehog Lab

## Getting Started

Welome to the **Hedgehog Lab**, a programming environment that allows you to:

- Execute and compile all **Hedgehog Script** in your local browser
- Do all kinds of scientific computing, machine learning, statistics and calculus
- Save, modify and share your script with anybody, anywhere in the world
- Wrap up your script as a module/function for other developers via `@username/filename`
- Explore and discover scripts from community
- Follow your favorate develpers and vote for great scripts

The first thing you want to do is open up "hlab.app" in chrome, firefox, etc. Preferably chrome as GPU acceleration runs on it by default.

There are many aspects of Hedgehog Lab to get familiar with, but they're relatively quick and easy. Through this book, we'll guide you on all the features and aspects of Hedgehog Lab.

Take a brief look at the various buttons and sidebars to familiarize yourself with Hedgehog Lab's layout and we'll begin explaining them.!
