# The Programming Language

**The language we use in Hedgehog Lab and some basic information about it...**

The programming language we use is called Hedgehog Script. It is compatible with and built on JavaScript/TypeScript.

There are many topics to cover regarding the programming language, and they can be found in the 'Hedgehog Script' book, where we cover them in detail.

For now, we just want to state some aspects of the scripting language: 

<ul>
<li> Uses JavaScript, a core technology of the World Wide Web </li>
<li> High level programming language </li>
<li> Dynamic typing </li>
<li> Prototype-base objects </li>
<li> Supports classes </li>
<li> Multi-paradigm (supports event-driven, functional and imperative programming styles) </li>
<li> And much more... </li>
</ul>
